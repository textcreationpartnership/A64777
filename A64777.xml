            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AGIATIS, Queen of SPARTA.</head>
            <p>WHILE the Common-Wealth of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> was divided by the Factions of its Kings, <hi>Agis</hi> and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidas,</hi> the City of <hi>Sparta</hi> was the Scene of a moſt bloody War. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was ſo viſible there, as Treaſons and Murders; all were put to the Fire and Sword; Infancy, or Old Age, found no Mercy; nor was any Reſpect given, either to the Rights of Blood, or the Perſonage of Kings. Even the Women were not there ſecure of their Lives, and they were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expos'd to Injuries more grievous than Death it ſelf. So ſtrange a Diſorder pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a Cauſe which was not leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:103174:3"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Agis,</hi> the Chief of the Royal Family of the <hi>Agiades,</hi> and deſcended from the famous <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> was no ſooner come to the Crown, but he endeavour'd to re-eſtabliſh the Ancient <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Diſcipline, and to make the Laws of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> to be obſerved. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of them did ordain an Aboliſhment of all Debts, and a general Partition of all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, to the end, that by reaſon of that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of Fortune, all the Citizens might have an equal Intereſt, in what had relation to the Publick. <hi>Agis</hi> was not above twenty years old, when he framed ſo great a Deſign; he had alſo been brought up in Luxury and Plenty, by the Queens <hi>Archidamia</hi> his Grandmother, and <hi>Ageſiſtrate</hi> his Mother.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Princeſſes were poſſeſſed of an infinite Wealth, and, either becauſe they were deſirous to retain it ſtill, or becauſe they were ſollicited by ſome Citizens, who were unwilling to renounce their Riches, they, at firſt, oppoſed <hi>Agis</hi>'s Intention, and conjured the Prince to change his Mind. <hi>For God ſake,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ageſiſtrate</hi> to him, <hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conſequences that are to be feared, and you will find, that your Reſolution can be no otherwiſe than diſagreeable to the</hi> Spartans. <hi>Do you believe they will be able to endure the Government of a Young Man, who, from the very firſt moment of his Reign, applies himſelf
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103174:3"/>only to their Ruine? To what Extremities will they not be carried againſt you, if, inſtead of complying with the times, you indeavour to bring them under an Auſterity of Life, that cannot be grateful to them? They are now more Gallant and Magnificent than their Anceſtors; and, if it be a Crime, at</hi> Sparta, <hi>to love Eaſe and Luxury, you will find few who are not Guilty. I know, Madam,</hi> replied <hi>Agis, that Men do not, without difficulty, paſs from a looſeneſs of Manners, to the practice of an exact Virtue; but alſo, we ſhall not, without Glory, overcome thoſe Difficulties. And, I pray, Madam, by what means would you have</hi> Agis <hi>render himſelf conſiderable among Kings? Is it by Treaſures? The Treaſurers of King</hi> Ptolomy, <hi>and the Lieutenants of</hi> Seleucus, <hi>have much greater than it is poſſible for a King of</hi> Lacedemon <hi>to have. No, it muſt be by the Contempt of thoſe things, which other Princes moſt affect. It muſt be by Moderation, and Continence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He added ſo many other Reaſons, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued with ſo much Solidity, that <hi>Archida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> and <hi>Ageſiſtrate</hi> were Convinced, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned to him their own Riches, to be diſpoſed of according to his Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agis</hi> employed all that the two Queens had put into his hands, for the Eaſe only and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103174:4"/>Succour of the Miſerable and Diſtreſſed; and his Liberality, together with the Reſolution he had taken, drew almoſt all the People to his Party.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, the principal <hi>Spartans</hi> ſided with <hi>Leonidas;</hi> they remonſtrated to him, that he being the Elder King, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Honour to fetch his Original from <hi>Hercules,</hi> it would be diſgraceful to him, to ſuffer himſelf to be ſupplanted by a Young Man. They preſſed him to oppoſe <hi>Agis</hi>'s Reſolution, and aſſured him, that that Prince hid an effectual Tyranny under an appearing Generoſity, and that he deſired to win the Peoples Favour, only to poſſeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of a ſingle and independent Soveraignty.</p>
            <p>Several Women embraced this Party, and engaged themſelves in it with much more concern, than they were uſed to do upon the like occaſions. They had their Reaſons for it. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> having never med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with any thing, but what related to the War, had always left the Adminiſtration of their Domeſtick Affairs to their Wives. So that they became Miſtreſſes of the Money, and could not conſent to loſe that which rendred them conſiderable. Neither did they forget any thing that could augment the Power of their Faction. Some did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Suffrages with ready Money, others
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103174:4"/>paid dearer for them; but the moſt diſcreet did quit a City, wherein they ſaw themſelves expos'd to a thouſand dangers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gilipus,</hi> a Prince of the Blood of the <hi>Agiades,</hi> was ſtrangely diſquieted for an only Daughter he had, whom he moſt tenderly loved. It was the admirable <hi>Agiatis,</hi> whom Hiſtory deſcribes unto us for the Faireſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of thoſe times. <hi>Agis</hi> was upon the point of Marrying ſo Charming a Creature; and <hi>Gilipus,</hi> that he might ſet his Heart at reſt, was very deſirous to haſten the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, or to ſend <hi>Agiatis</hi> into a place of Safety. Before the Execution of either of theſe Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, he advis'd with a <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Democares,</hi> who was abſolutely at his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. <hi>Are not you of an Opinion,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>that I ſend</hi> Agiatis <hi>far from a Country—How, Sir,</hi> interrupted <hi>Democares,</hi> with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough in his Countenance, <hi>would you—Be not allarmed,</hi> replied <hi>Gilipus</hi> ſmilingly, <hi>the Fair one, whom you love, ſhall not follow</hi> Agiatis; <hi>and I can, by the conſent of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, diſpoſe of her in your Favour. Sir,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Democares, I ſpeak on another account. I apprehend you may ſhake the Courage of our Faction, if you make it known, that you are in fear for the Princeſs. Well then,</hi> replied <hi>Gili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, I will take other meaſures, and the King by eſpouſing</hi> Agiatis, <hi>ſhall charge himſelf with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103174:5"/>the care ſhe may give me. Ah, Sir,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted <hi>Democares, that way is much more dangerous. Will you give a Princeſs, who is ſo dear unto you, to a Prince whoſe undertakings may produce lamentable Conſquences? For Gods ſake be not too haſty, and diſpoſe not of the Princeſs, but according to the ſucceſs which our Civil Wars ſhall have.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Democares</hi> continued his Diſcourſe; and as he was one of the moſt violent Men of <hi>Sparta,</hi> he repreſented ſo livelily, what might be feared for <hi>Agis,</hi> that <hi>Gilipus</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Reſolution, and grew more Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly. He judg'd that the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble among the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> would never ſuffer the Dominion of a Prince, who would deprive them of their Eſtates; and he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied all his Cares, not only to ſtrengthen the League of the <hi>Agiades;</hi> but his curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty carried him ſo far, as to deſire to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, in what was to be the Deſtiny of the King and Princeſs. He conſulted a Learned Man of the Iſle of <hi>Andros,</hi> whom ſeveral Predictions had render'd famous over all <hi>Peloponeſus,</hi> and he conjur'd him to work upon his Queſtion, with all the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his Art required. <hi>Corymbas,</hi> that was the Stranger's Name, applied himſelf; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Intentions of <hi>Gilipus,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards went to give him an account of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103174:5"/>Obſervations he had made.
<q>What can you inform me, ſaid the Prince to him, of a Daughter's Fate, whom I love with tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? That, according to the Rules of my Science, replied he, Fortune will not be her Enemy: But, Sir, I am oblig'd to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you, that this fair Princeſs is in danger of being Raviſht. I ſee too plainly, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Gilipus,</hi> our Civil Wars are the Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that threaten us with that Misfortune; but, <hi>Corymbas,</hi> I will uſe Precaution. In the mean time, to eaſe my Melancholly, let us diſcourſe of the King, and tell me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heaven does promiſe him as much Happineſs, as his Virtue gives him Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The name of <hi>Agis,</hi> replied <hi>Corymbas,</hi> ſhall, without doubt, reach the utmoſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; but may I tell you, that the Prince is in danger of ending his Life, by the moſt deplorable Death that ever was heard of: That which will be moſt ſtrange in his Fate is, That he ſhall be drawn to it by thoſe Perſons, in whom he ſhall have a moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Confidence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gilipus,</hi> frightned with this Prediction, went immediately to <hi>Agis,</hi> related to him what he had then learnt, and conjured him never to make any particular Bond of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for fear of putting ſome ſecret Enemy in a Condition to betray him. The King
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103174:6"/>heard him, without being at all moved; and after he had thanked him for his obliging Fear:
<q>Sir, <hi>continued he,</hi> I had rather dye, than live in a continual diſtruſt. All I have to do, is to reſign my ſelf up to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Gods, and to act nothing that may make me deſerve the misfortune you apprehend for me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince gave not over acting as he did before, in order to put his Deſigns in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; and it was about this time that <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> the <hi>Ephore,</hi> who was of his Faction, accuſed <hi>Leonidas</hi> of being Married in <hi>Aſia,</hi> contrary to a Law which did forbid the Princes of the Race of <hi>Hercules</hi> to take ſtrange Women to their Wives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonidas</hi> feared the Conſequences of that Accuſation ſo much, that he fled away with the Princeſs <hi>Cheloniſe</hi> his Daughter, and went to <hi>Tegeum,</hi> where the Queen <hi>Creteſilea</hi> had already taken refuge with her Son <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes.</hi> This young Prince being, as yet, not above fifteen or ſixteen years old, would fain have returned to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> to revenge the King his Father's Quarrel. <hi>Leonidas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to him, that the time was not yet ripe for it. He told him, that his Faction was weak, and that therefore ſuch an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, muſt of neceſſity be delayed.
<q>Sir, replyed <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> if your Friends are not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103174:6"/>numerous enough to follow me openly, I will attack your Enemies after another faſhion; and poſſibly their Chief ſhall find but little ſafety in a City where he may be met with by <hi>Cleomenes.</hi> Son, replied <hi>Leonidas,</hi> Civil Wars are ſubject to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Changes, that you may well reſerve your ſelf for a more favourable occaſion.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> was with much a do Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and <hi>Leonidas,</hi> having reflected upon his Humour, thought it convenient, that this young Prince ſhould, for a while, reſide a little further from <hi>Sparta.</hi> He reſolved to ſend him a travelling, and truſted him to the Conduct of a <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> called <hi>Xenares,</hi> with whoſe Affection and Experience he was well acquainted. They departed in a few days after; and <hi>Xenares</hi> ſtudied by what means he might preſerve, in ſafety, the Pledge put into his Hands. He thought of no better or ſecurer way, than to keep <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> from being known. He made him change his Name, and it was under the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed one of <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> that the Prince ſaw <hi>Argos,</hi> and paſſed even to <hi>Epidaurus.</hi> He had a mind to go to Sea, in order to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit the Iſlands of the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea, when he heard news that made him change his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, in hopes of ſome opportunity to ſignalize himſelf. He was told that <hi>Aratus,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:103174:7"/>the Captain General of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make War in <hi>Aetolia;</hi> that he levied Troops about <hi>Corinth;</hi> and that he had writ to the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to ſend him the Succours they were obliged to give him by a Treaty of Alliance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> rejoiced at it, and told <hi>Xenares,</hi> that he need no longer trouble himſelf about Embarking.
<q>It is not fit, continued he, that we go now out of a Country, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we muſt have returned to ſeek out the War, had we been already departed. The greateſt of my Ambition ſhall always be to ſatisfie you, replied <hi>Xenares,</hi> eſpecially, when you will have ſuch generous Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but, Sir, to ſpeak unto you ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you confound me upon this occaſion: For I do not perceive, it will be eaſie for you to reſolve what Party you ought to take. You ſtill love <hi>Lacedemon</hi> too well, to go and put your ſelf among the <hi>Etalian</hi> Troops; and, on the other ſide, you cannot remain long among the <hi>Spartans,</hi> without diſcovering that you are the Prince <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> We will find a Mean between theſe two extreams, replied <hi>Themiſtides.</hi> We will ſerve under <hi>Aratus,</hi> for the Allies of our Country, as ordinary <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> and there is little probability the <hi>Achaians</hi> ſhould know me. Do you think, replied
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103174:7"/>
                  <hi>Xenares,</hi> on the continual Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that there will be between the Army of <hi>Agis,</hi> and that of <hi>Aratus</hi>—No Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I pray you, interrupted <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> let us go to <hi>Corinth;</hi> there we may exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine matters a little nearer, and take juſter meaſures.</q> 
               <hi>Xenares</hi> conſented to it, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way they marched towards the City, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had a deſire to go.</p>
            <p>They lodged with one <hi>Neranthus,</hi> a Friend of <hi>Xenares,</hi> and they applied themſelves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, with all Care, to be informed of every thing, concerning the preparations of War that were made. They underſtood that the <hi>Achaians</hi> had already fifteen or ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand Men; that they expected the Troops promiſed them by <hi>Corinth,</hi> and a Re-inforcement of two thouſand <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> which King <hi>Agis</hi> was to lead.
<q>Will it pleaſe you, ſaid <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to <hi>Xenares,</hi> that I ſatisfie the deſire I have, of ſeeing the General of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> I have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies touched at the Reputation of that Great Man; and I fancy that I may one day, either follow him near at hand in Battel, if we fight for the ſame Intereſts, or diſpute with him a Victory, if we chance to break with <hi>Achaia.</hi> I doubt not, Sir, replied <hi>Xenares,</hi> but that you may in a little time, do both the one and the other;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103174:8"/>and I hope, that then Men will wiſh as much to know the Illuſtrious <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> as you ſhew earneſtneſs now, to ſee the Famous <hi>Aratus.</hi> But I think you may ſatisfie your Curioſity, without going to the Camp of the <hi>Achaians.</hi> I have heard it reported, that <hi>Aratus</hi> often comes to <hi>Corinth,</hi> which we will know more certainly,</q> as ſoon as you pleaſe.</p>
            <p>In that very moment <hi>Neranthus</hi> came to preſent his Son <hi>Philiſtion</hi> to <hi>Xenares</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtides. Philiſtion</hi> was a handſome young Man, and had already acquired ſome Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the War. He was ſurpriz'd with the good Meen of <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> and teſtified to him, that he would be very glad to be his Guide, to ſhew him the Rarities, and to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him into the beſt Societies of the City.
<q>I would, in the firſt place, intreat you, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> after he made all the Compliments to which <hi>Philiſtion</hi> could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, to tell me, whether <hi>Aratus</hi> does not come ſometimes to <hi>Corinth?</hi> He comes hither as often as he can, replied <hi>Philiſtion.</hi> But at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we judge, that it is not always to confer with our Magiſtrates; it is rather to viſit a young Lady, named <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> who is the moſt Charming, and the moſt accompliſht Beauty of <hi>Greece.</hi> Is it poſſible, interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> that a Man of that Age, and of that Merit, can be capable of ſuch
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103174:8"/>a weakneſs? Many Men have been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at it, as you have been, replied <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtion,</hi> but their wonder ceaſed, as ſoon as they have ſeen <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> and yours alſo ſhall ceaſe to morrow morning, if you pleaſe to go to the Temple of <hi>Neptune,</hi> at the hour I ſhall call upon you. What! I go ſo far as your <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> in ſearch of a Temple, to ſee <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> replied <hi>Cleomenes</hi> ſmiling! I aſſure you, I ſhall not do it, I had rather a great deal keep my wonder. You will be happy, replied <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> if you always preſerve that indifference: it cannot be ſaid that you reſemble a Nephew of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>'s, named <hi>Teleander,</hi> who is in Love wherever he finds amiable Perſons. He is lately come to <hi>Corinth,</hi> where <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> who Charmed him preſently, hath made him forget a young <hi>Athenian</hi> Lady, whom he would fain have Married. I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, ſaid <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> how a Man can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſo ſoon from one Engagement to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Several Men, replied <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> do leſs underſtand how it can be poſſible to be always conſtant to the ſame Perſon; but inſtead of diſputing on the difference of Humours, I will tell you, that Feaſts and Divertiſements, are the only Diſcourſe of this Town, ever ſince the Arrival of <hi>Telean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and his Siſter <hi>Ariamite</hi> in it. I know,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103174:9"/>replied <hi>Xenares,</hi> that <hi>Teleander</hi> is the Son of <hi>Onecryſa,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Aratus,</hi> and Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the Prince of <hi>Erymanthus;</hi> but I confeſs I never heard of that <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> whoſe Beauty you ſo much applaud. I know her little better than you, replied <hi>Philiſtion</hi> She has not been long at <hi>Corinth,</hi> whither <hi>Leriana,</hi> her Mother, hath brought her to a Brother's Houſe, which ſhe hath, called <hi>Leoſthenes.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This Converſation ended, <hi>Philiſtion</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Xenares</hi> and <hi>Themiſtides</hi> to ſee ſeveral Works, in that <hi>Corinthian</hi> Braſs which was ſo much eſteemed by the Ancients; and on the morrow he being informed that <hi>Aratu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> was newly arrived, he failed not to give <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtides</hi> notice of it.
<q>Without doubt you know, purſued he, that we are very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to celebrate our <hi>Iſtmique</hi> Games; and ſince they are uſually frequented by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of Strangers, it is thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, to ſend away ſome Troops which we have about the City, in order to free the high ways. <hi>Aratus</hi> is now with our Magiſtrates, conſidering into what Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to diſpoſe of them; and I am told he will come afterwards to take the Air in a Garden, which our famous <hi>Timoleon</hi> cauſed to be beautified, for the Divertiſement of the People. Were it only in conſideration
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103174:9"/>of that Great Captain, whom you named, anſwered <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> we will go as ſoon as you pleaſe, into a place of which he was pleaſed to take care.</q> 
               <hi>Philiſtion</hi> led him thither, and ſhewing him an Alley on the left hand;
<q>There, ſaid he, <hi>Aratus</hi> uſually walks. The Multitude, you ſee, is come hither upon the ſame deſign as you are. But when we ſhall have ſeen the General of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> we will go and view the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-works, the Grotto's, and Statues. With all my Heart, replied <hi>Themiſtides;</hi> thoſe are the Ornaments that pleaſe me beſt in a Garden.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He had hardly ended theſe words, when he ſaw ſeveral People mend their pace, and over-heard them whiſper among themſelves, that <hi>Aratus</hi> was ſtopt in the Street, with <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſira</hi> and <hi>Leriana.</hi>
               <q>How, ſaid <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> that <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> whom you eſteem ſo Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, will not ſhe come to take the Air? I do not believe, replied <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> that ſhe will come, and ſhew her ſelf in theſe walks; ſhe avoids occaſions of ſhewing her ſelf, as carefully, as other fair Ladies are earneſt in ſeeking them: But, added he, advancing towards the Gate, you had better come and ſee her, than I ſpeak of her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> followed him out, and had no ſooner caſt his Eyes upon <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> but he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103174:10"/>was as it were dazled with her Complexion. But if the luſter of that admirable Perſon did at firſt ſurprize him; the Beauty of her Stature, the flame of her Eyes, the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of her Features, and a certain agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, which Youth ſpreads over the Face did in a few moments after produce a much more powerful effect. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> felt the ſecret Charm, and it was the firſt time that his Heart was moved by an unruly Joy, with which he was not then acquainted. He was tyed as it were with a Chain to <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſira,</hi> and followed, with his Eyes, that fair Creature, as far as it was poſſible for him, when ſhe went away with <hi>Aratus</hi> and <hi>Leria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na. Philiſtion,</hi> who did not obſerve his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, propoſed to him to go and ſee the Water-works and Statues.
<q>We ſhall ſee them when we pleaſe, replied <hi>Themiſtides.</hi> They ſtand ſtill, <hi>Aratus</hi> goes away, and poſſibly I ſhall never ſee him more in my Life.</q> After theſe words, he caſt his Eyes ſpeedily upon <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> and beheld her with extream application. As ſoon as he had loſt ſight of her, he fell into a fit of Muſing, and returned home, without ſpeaking one word. This ſilence continued ſo long after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, that <hi>Xenares</hi> taking notice of it, ſaid,
<q>I cannot think that you come from ſeeing <hi>Aratus,</hi> ſince you tell me nothing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103174:10"/>of him. Have you experienced this day, what I have a thouſand times obſerved, That the Reputation of a great Man, is not always ſupported by a good preſence? I do not wonder, replied <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> at what you have ſo frequently obſerved. Thoſe who deſcribe unto us ſome extraordinary Perſons, take delight in amplifications, on purpoſe to attract our Admiration; and on our ſide, the Imagination carries us yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than the Recital which we hear. Young as I am, I, my ſelf, have obſerved, that the greater part of thoſe things, which Fame has made me deſirous of ſeeing, have afterwards appeared not ſo fair, as they were repreſented to me, whether they were Houſes, Statues, or Pictures. You will not fail, in a little time to cite the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men alſo, replied <hi>Xenares,</hi> ſmiling, and I am perſuaded, you will not eſteem thoſe over Charming, who paſs in the World for accompliſht Beauties. I ſhould be apt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to believe the contrary of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, replied <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> bluſhing; for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks their preſence can create an emotion of the Heart, which the bare relation of their Beauties cannot make a Man feel. Ah, <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> replied <hi>Xenares</hi> with Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, I plainly perceive that you have much more to ſay of <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> than of <hi>Aratus,</hi> and I am no longer ignorant of what <gap reason="missing" extent="4 pages">

               <hi>Gods inexorable to your Prayers, as long as you are ſo to</hi> Teleander<hi>'s.</hi> She anſwered him with a firm voice. <hi>Sir, I know not what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign hath brought you into this Temple, but, for my own part, I am come only to Pray unto that God who is here adored, and you will pleaſure me not to interrupt me. Teleander</hi> durſt make no reply; the Victims were brought, and the Sacrifice was made.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Leriana</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> departed, <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> led them to their Chariot, and <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> followed them with his Eyes, as far as he could. He having obſerved <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> with attention, when ſhe ſpoke to <hi>Teleander,</hi> ſaid to <hi>Philiſtion: Either I am deceived, or</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſira <hi>is very diſdainful. She is poſſibly much more ſo, than you imagine,</hi> anſwered he, <hi>and you may gueſs, by the way wherewith you have ſeen her treat</hi> Teleander, <hi>whether ſhe would be more favourable to Lovers of a lower form. I have already told you,</hi> replied <hi>Cleomenes, that I have not the ſame Pretenſions, as the Prince</hi> Erymanthus; <hi>and that I do not deſire to ſubject</hi> Cyleſira's <hi>liberty. But may not that fair Creature, and</hi> Themiſtides, <hi>have a Complaiſance and Friendſhip for each other. Conſidering how you two are made,</hi> replied <hi>Philiſtion, I confeſs, it would be no difficult task for you to love each other; but I queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether it would be eaſie for you, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103174:11"/>your ſelf with that tenderneſs, without deſiring to be united; and it is for ſuch an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion that you would find the greateſt Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. For your part, you are too young to be Maſter of your own will; and you ſeem to be born of Parents, who would not be over-well pleaſed with you, if you ſhould make ſuch an Alliance. On the other ſide,</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>whoſe Heart is above her Condition, would not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be very forward to give you her conſent; and perhaps ſhe would anſwer you after a manner, not to be expected from</hi> Leriana<hi>'s Daughter. Cleomenes</hi> muſed for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; he could not forbear ſighing, and afterwards renewing the Diſcourſe, he ſaid. <hi>I plainly perceive, there is but too much truth in what you ſay of</hi> Cyleſira; <hi>and that I had better not affect a Perſon of her humour. I can alſo aſſure you, that I will never yield my ſelf without reſiſtance, and that I will do my utmoſt endeavours to defend my Heart againſt a paſſion that would fain be ſo much Miſtreſs of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inſtead of continuing this Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he went to walk all alone, and after changing, an hundred times his Reſolution, he ſtill repeated to himſelf, that he ſhould be the happieſt Man of the World, if he could win the Love of <hi>Cyleſira.</hi> He believed that <hi>Philiſtion</hi> could ſerve him profitably, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103174:12"/>he thought there was no better way to gain that young <hi>Corinthian,</hi> than to diſcover to him, that he was the Son of <hi>Leonidas.</hi> He went immediately to find him out, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him with an Air, which made him expect ſomething extraordinary, he ſaid to him: <hi>I muſt intruſt you with an important ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret; and you muſt promiſe me your aſſiſtance.</hi> Then he declared unto him what was his Birth, and confeſt, that he felt a moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Paſſion for <hi>Cyleſira. Sir,</hi> replied <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, I am not ſurpriſed to underſtand that you are a King's Son. A certain Character of Greatneſs, which I obſerved in your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and behaviour, has always perſuaded me, that your Birth muſt of neceſſity have been Illuſtrious: But, Sir, will the Prince</hi> Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes <hi>pardon me the Faults, which my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance hath made me commit againſt</hi> Themiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des? <hi>You have been far from committing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> replied <hi>Cleomenes. I intreat you to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame Conduct, leſt you ſhould raiſe in others, a ſuſpicion of the truth I now tell you. But above all things, my Dear</hi> Philiſtion, <hi>you muſt obtain for me an abſolute permiſſion, to go ſometimes to</hi> Leoſthenes<hi>'s Houſe. Ah, Sir,</hi> replied <hi>Philiſtion, give me leave to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my ſelf more worthy of the Confidence you have been pleaſed to place in me, and let me not endeavour to unite the Son of</hi> Leonidas,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103174:12"/>
               <hi>to</hi> Leriana<hi>'s Daughter. Let us not talk of that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> replied <hi>Cleomenes, I never think of it without a mortal vexation. I am ſure ſhe would make my Life happy; but when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wherein, and upon whom I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, I know neither what I would, nor what I could do, nor what I ought to do. How, Sir,</hi> replied <hi>Philiſtion, is it difficult for a Prince, who, one day, muſt raign over the</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians, <hi>and whoſe Family wants a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Alliance—No Reflexions, I intreat you,</hi> interrupted <hi>Cleomenes. Young as I am, I can make them my ſelf; and look upon things as they are. But I ſhall only tell you, that the Counſel you are about to give me, is not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as the aſſiſtance I demand of you. Grant it me, unleſs you would have me be the moſt unfortunate of Men, and do not amuſe your ſelf to combat a Paſſion, which neither you nor I can overcome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He continued to urge him ſtill with ſo much earneſtneſs, that at length he obtained what he deſired; and <hi>Philiſtion</hi> did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him, without reſolving to ſeek out ſome means of ſatisfying him. He at firſt perceived very great difficulties. <hi>Leriana</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> did not care to make new Acquaintan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and it was not very probable, that in a time wherein they refuſed the viſits of ſome of <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi>'s Friends, they would receive any from a Stranger.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:103174:13"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Philiſtion</hi> took another courſe; he was of opinion, that it was beſt to preſent <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> to the General of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> as a young Cavalier, who had an Ambition to ſerve under him. He judged it would not be difficult, to introduce him afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Onecryſa</hi>'s Family; and he could not miſs there of opportunities to ſee <hi>Cyleſira.</hi> This way of bringing <hi>Cleomenes</hi> acquainted, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to him very natural, and not at all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to create any ſuſpicions in <hi>Leriana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had not throughly reſolved upon this, when Chance offered him another expedient, which he made choice of without delay. One of his Friends came and propoſed to him, to make one at a Feaſt which <hi>Teleander</hi> would give <hi>Cyleſira.</hi> He told him, that the fair Lady was to depart from <hi>Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

He alſo acquainted him, that <hi>Onecryſa</hi> would give a prize for the Courſes, and that afterwards there would be a Ball at her Houſe. <hi>Conſider then,</hi> added the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian, whether you will make one or no. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, at leaſt,</hi> replied <hi>Philiſtion, to give my place to a Man, that will ſupply it better than my ſelf; and I am miſtaken, if the World will
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103174:13"/>will not be of my Opinion.</hi> It was <hi>Themiſtides</hi> he meant, to whom he had hardly told the news, but the Prince was at firſt troubled with the thought of <hi>Leriana</hi>'s departure; but imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they would make no ſecret of the place, whereunto ſhe would go, his vexation gave way to the Joy he conceived, for being a Party in the Divertiſements that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for <hi>Cyleſira.</hi> He prepared himſelf for that occaſion, when <hi>Xenares,</hi> to whom he was obliged to ſpeak of it, oppoſed his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; though he was as yet ignorant to whom that Feaſt was intended. He repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Prince, that he would expoſe himſelf to be known, if he ſhould appear in thoſe Courſes. <hi>I confeſs,</hi> anſwered <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that you would have reaſon to fear ſuch a thing in the</hi> Iſthmick <hi>Games. I know, that ſeveral People may come thither from</hi> Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>as well as from other parts of</hi> Greece. <hi>But in the Divertiſements we ſpeak of, there will be onely ſome Gentlemen of</hi> Corinth, <hi>who ſee me every minute in the Temples and Streets. Sir,</hi> replied <hi>Xenares, I conſent to what you deſire, provided that we afterwards depart from</hi> Corinth, <hi>and that you ask not to ſee thoſe Games, wherein you your ſelf confeſs, you may be in danger of being known.</hi>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103174:14"/>pleaſe me better, than to ſhew that you are Maſter of your Heart, in ſpight of the fire of your Youth and Temper. You are willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from</hi> Cyleſira; <hi>that is to ſay, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the ſight of a Lady that pleaſes you, and is the firſt that ever pleaſed you; and ſince in this your Age, your Reaſon is ſo much above your Paſſions, we may well hope it will always maintain that Empire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> received this piece of Applauſe ſo coldly, that <hi>Xenares</hi> believed he knew the reaſon of it. <hi>I perceive well enough, Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that, to ſatisfie you entirely, I muſt write this news to the King. Be not in two much haſte</hi> Xenares, replied the Prince, <hi>know firſt whether I deſerve the Praiſes you give me. I never ſtudied to gain them, neither can I leave you in the Opinion wherein you are. Were I capable of holding my Tongue upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhould look upon my ſilence, as a diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I could not pardon in my ſelf. Know then, that I am willing to depart, only becauſe I am aſſured, that</hi> Cyleſira <hi>is not to ſtay at</hi> Corinth <hi>any longer, than to ſee the Feaſt that is prepared for her. You ſee that I do my ſelf no great Violence, in quitting a Town wherein</hi> Cyleſira <hi>will not remain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xenares</hi> concealing part of his Diſpleaſure, replied, <hi>I am at leaſt contented with your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and I hope I ſhall be throughly ſatisfied
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103174:14"/>with your Carriage, when you will be at ſome diſtance from</hi> Cyleſira. This was the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer he thought fit to give, without expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any Vexation, after the frank Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Prince had made. He was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> ſhould appear at the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, as he himſelf pleaſed. He did not omit to procure every thing for him, that could be uſeful, either in ſetting off his good Meen, or aſſiſting his Dexterity. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the Complaiſance he ſhould now ſhew, would give him right to exact others upon more important occaſions.</p>
            <p>The Divertiſement of theſe Courſes was upon the <hi>Iſthmus.</hi> There were ſeveral Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds Erected for Perſons of Quality. And <hi>Onecryſa</hi>'s was ſpread with rich <hi>Tyrian</hi> Tapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; but it may be ſaid, that <hi>Ariamite</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> were the principal Ornaments. They were hardly ſeated when <hi>Teleander</hi> appeared with ten other Cavaliers; ſome of them were of the moſt conſiderable Families of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and the reſt were choſe out of the principal Officers of the <hi>Achaians.</hi> They were all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well mounted, and ſumptuouſly habited. <hi>Teleander</hi>'s Horſe was one of the faireſt that <hi>Spain</hi> ever brought forth upon the Banks of <hi>Betis.</hi> The Prince managed him gracefully, and having ſaluted the Ladies with a very good Grace, he was ſtrangely ſurpriſed to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103174:15"/>ſingle out <hi>Philiſtion</hi> in the Crowd a foot, in his ordinary Habit. He cried out to him, <hi>Is it poſſible that you are not yet ready? Sir,</hi> replied <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> without any concern, <hi>you may begin when you pleaſe; I have given my place to a Man, with whom you will be better ſatisfied than with</hi> Philiſtion. He had no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ended theſe words, but they ſaw the Prince of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> appear. The whole Aſſembly caſt their Eyes immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and ſixt them with a kind of aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> was mounted on a Barb, the handſomeſt and proudeſt that had in a long time come from the Coaſts of <hi>Africa.</hi> An hundred fair Plumes waved up and down upon his Cask. He had a Coat of Mail, of a Carnation Colour, and enriched with em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery of Gold. He carried a Spear in his right Hand, and his left Arm was covered with a Shield, ſparkling in ſeveral places with rich Gems. He advanced with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and eaſie Air towards <hi>Onecryſa</hi>'s Scaffold, and having bowed to her with great reſpect, he addreſſed himſelf to <hi>Teleander</hi> in theſe terms. <hi>Sir, I am doubtful whether you will pardon</hi> Philiſtion, <hi>for having given me his place.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Erymanthus,</hi> after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving attentively beheld. <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> made anſwer. <hi>I think indeed, that</hi> Philiſtion <hi>will have done us an Injury, but it is after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103174:15"/>that you would be unwilling to own. In the mean time, Sir, inſtead of entering into Conteſtation, we had better wait for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Courſes, thanto talk upon Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures. If you pleaſe to drive a Chariot, there are twelve prepared for us.</hi> He ſhewed them. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> accepted of his proffer, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with the Cavaliers to the end of the Career. Though all the Chariots had four Horſes a piece in a Breaſt, almoſt all of an equal goodneſs; yet they did not forbear to draw Lots for them. Every Man took that which Chance gave him; and having made tryal of it, the whole Company joyned again together, and ſtarted away with Fury, as ſoon as the Signal was given. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> did at firſt curb in his Horſes; but he was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the middle of the Career, when he gave them a looſe, and drove them on ſo vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, that he left the reſt of the Cavaliers far behind him. The ſwiftneſs with which he ran, did not at all diſturb him. On the contrary, there appeared in his Countenance neither Conſtraint nor Confuſion. He was obſerved to carry himſelf with as free and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie an Air, as in ordinary walking. The whole World applauded ſo fair a Courſe, and <hi>Teleander</hi> not being able to endure it, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to break a Spear. <hi>Onecry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> was not wanting to oppoſe his deſire;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103174:16"/>but <hi>Teleander</hi> did ſo ſtubbornly inſiſt upon it, that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> looked upon the Princeſs of <hi>Erymanthus,</hi> as it were, to teſtify unto her, that it was with regret he ſaw himſelf obliged to diſpleaſe her. He alighted from his Chariot, took his Horſe, and marched towards one end of the Career, whilſt <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> advanced towards the other. Preſently after they ſet out at the ſound of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and met each other with ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity, that their Spears broke upon their Shields into ſeveral Splinters. Nevertheleſs the advantage was not equal. The Prince of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> finiſht his Career with a good Grace, but <hi>Teleander</hi> was ſo ſhaken, that he had much ado to recover his firſt ſeat. The ſecond Courſe had a ſucceſs more diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent than the former; <hi>Themiſtides</hi> was ſhaken in his turn; but the Prince of <hi>Erymanthus</hi> loſt his Stirrops, and ſtaggered, almoſt thrown back upon the Crupper of his Horſe. The whole Aſſembly cried out, it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; the two Combatants were parted, and there appeared others in the Liſt, whoſe Actions it is not neceſſary to deſcribe. 'Twill be ſufficient to ſay, that <hi>Teleander</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came two of them, and that <hi>Themiſtides</hi> gain'd a clear advantage over four others. In the end, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> was proclaimed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour with Applauſe, and they led him,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103174:16"/>as it were in Triumph, to <hi>Onecryſa</hi>'s Scaffold. As ſoon as he was come up to the Princeſs, he would have kneeled, but <hi>Onecryſa,</hi> oppoſing it, roſe up from her ſeat, and preſented him with a Bracelet of Diamonds. <hi>Receive,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, after a moſt obliging manner, <hi>the recompence you have deſerved with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Approbation. Since you command it, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> anſwered he, <hi>I accept of a Priae, which Addreſs and Dexterity would have given the Prince of</hi> Erymanthus, <hi>if Fortune had not concerned her ſelf in our Courſes. However,</hi> replied <hi>Ariamite, it ſeems that Chance had no great ſhare in what you have done, and I know not whether your Air, at your firſt appearance, did not promiſe the Victory you have obtained.</hi> In ſaying this, ſhe attentively beheld <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes;</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> her ſelf, caſt her Eyes more than once on this Prince.</p>
            <p>This Converſation did not continue lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for ſeveral Perſons of Quality paſſed from their own Scaffolds to <hi>Onecryſa</hi>'s, and <hi>Aratus</hi> did intreat the Cavaliers to go and diſarm themſelves, and to come afterwards to his Siſters Houſe. The Princeſs of <hi>Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthus</hi> gave this numerous Company an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, admirable for its Delicacy and Abundance. Afterwards Dancing was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and it was reſolved, that <hi>Themiſtides</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> ſhould have the Honours of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103174:17"/>Ball. <hi>Teleander</hi> was vext at it, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to the Prince of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Confeſs, Sir, that you are much happier than you expected; but perhaps you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unacquainted with the Charming</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>are not ſo much moved with the good that is deſigned you, as another Man would be. You are deceived, Brother,</hi> replied <hi>Ariamite,</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſira <hi>and</hi> Themiſtides <hi>have already ſeen each other; and</hi> Cyleſira <hi>has ſome time ſince told me, that ſhe ſaw</hi> Themiſtides, <hi>the other day, in the Temple of</hi> Neptune. <hi>How, Madam,</hi> ſaid <hi>Teleander</hi> to <hi>Cyleſira, did you ſingle out</hi> Themiſtides <hi>in a Crowd, that aſſiſted at the Sacrifice, and have you preſerved the Idea of him ſo freſh in your Memory, as to know him again this day, in ſpight of the alteration which his Arms and differing Habits might occaſion in his Air and Viſage. Cyleſira</hi> bluſht, and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> having taken notice of it, believed that he was obliged to anſwer, in order to deliver her out of her Confuſion. <hi>Methinks,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>my being a Stranger, was cauſe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, to make me to be obſerved among thoſe People who are uſed to be ſeen every day. It may be alſo affirmed,</hi> replied <hi>Cyleſira</hi> to <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> a purpoſe to give <hi>Teleander</hi> a little vexation, <hi>that we ſee few ſuch Strangers as</hi> Themiſtides. <hi>That is the reaſon,</hi> interrupted <hi>Teleander, that you ſo well remember him. I
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103174:17"/>have poſſibly a better memory than you imagine,</hi> replied ſhe coldly, <hi>and as a further mark of it, I have not forgot, that that very morning you would neither ſuffer me to Pray, nor Pray your ſelf.</hi> They could not continue this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, being come into the Hall. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies took their places; the Muſick began to play, and <hi>Onecryſa</hi> intreated <hi>Themiſtides</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> to begin. They Danced, the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly admired them; and it was declared with one general Voice, that there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any thing ſeen finer in all <hi>Greece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> could not lead <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> without reliſhing a certain ſweetneſs, which he eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above all Pleaſures; and he had hardly finiſht his Dance, when, looking upon that Beautiful Creature, after a tender and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful manner, he ſaid, <hi>This ſecond hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, which I owe to my ſucceſs at the Courſes, is infinitely greater than the firſt; and I had much rather give my hand to the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>than have received from</hi> One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryſa<hi>'s the Diamonds which ſhe gave me as a Preſent. Nevertheleſs, I think there is a great difference between them,</hi> anſwered ſhe ſmiling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>and how diſ-intereſſed ſoever you may be, you will, within this two or three hours per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the Bull will be at an end, and that the Bracelet will ſtill remain with you. But, Madam,</hi> replied <hi>Themiſtides, does the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103174:18"/>I have depend ſo abſolutely on the Ball, that I may never pretend unto it otherwiſe, than by a means which Fortune ſo rarely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyleſira</hi> could not anſwer him. <hi>Teleander</hi> approacht, and interrupted a Converſation, which he could not indure without trouble. On the other ſide, <hi>Ariamite</hi> addreſſed her Speech to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and praiſing the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Dancing, ſaid,
<q>How! <hi>Themiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> muſt you carry away all the Prizes? It may be, purſued <hi>Onecryſa,</hi> moſt obligingly, he will make a Conqueſt, that will be more agreeable to him than his other Victories. I aſſure you, Madam, replied <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> it would be much eaſier for me to loſe on that ſide, than to win. I think he is in the right, replied <hi>Aratus,</hi> and that it will not be eaſie for him to depart free from a place, where there are ſo many Charming Objects.</q> This was the way they ſpent the reſt of the Evening, but it was by fits and at ſeveral times, as <hi>Cleomenes, Cyleſira, Teleander,</hi> or <hi>Ariamite</hi> were drawn out to Dance, or returned from it.</p>
            <p>On the morrow morning <hi>Xenares</hi> came into <hi>Cleomenes</hi> his Chamber, and after he had Congratulated with the Prince, the ſucceſs he had had at the Courſes, he added,
<q>Sir, it is high time that you keep your word with
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103174:18"/>me, and that we depart. However, I could wiſh, anſwered <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> you would ſtay two or three days longer. I would conſent to it with all my Soul, replied <hi>Xenares,</hi> were it to ſee any thing that were worthy of your Curioſity. Let us go this Afternoon to the Cittadel. You know it is called <hi>Acrocorinth,</hi> and there is no place of ſuch importance in all <hi>Europe. Philip,</hi> the Father of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, called it the Fetters of <hi>Greece.</hi> When you ſhall have conſidered its Scituation and Ramparts, you will ſee, that it effectually holds ſeveral Provinces, as it were, in a Chain. It ſtands upon the famous <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> that joins <hi>Peloponeſus</hi> to <hi>Beotia</hi> and <hi>Attica.</hi> That is a thing that a Prince of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> ſhould examine with Application, inſtead of ſighing for the firſt Lady whom he finds Beautiful. Since your Intentions to me are no other than good, replied <hi>Cleomenes</hi> coldly, I will not take ill the Reproaches you make me. But, <hi>Xenares,</hi> will Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, after what paſt yeſterday, give me leave to depart, without paying a viſit to <hi>Onecryſa</hi> and <hi>Leriana?</hi> Well then, replied <hi>Xenares,</hi> I allow you a day to do it. I pray let us afterwards depart. But would you not have me, <hi>replied the Prince,</hi> take a view of <hi>Acrocorinth,</hi> and make my
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103174:19"/>Court a little to <hi>Aratus,</hi> under whom you have conſented I may ſerve. Take then four days, interrupted <hi>Xenares,</hi> with vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but let us afterwards depart, if you pleaſe, without delaying one moment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>While <hi>Themiſtides</hi> was thus grieved, to ſee his Paſſion condemned, his Rival found no better treatment at <hi>Onecryſa's. Aratus</hi> could not ſuffer his Affection for <hi>Cyleſira.</hi>
               <q>I would fain know, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> what Pretenſions you have upon <hi>Leriana</hi>'s Daughter? If it be to take her to Wife, you had better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part immediately for the Camp, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn no more to <hi>Corinth.</hi> It is not out of ill humour, that I talk thus unto you. You ſaw I did not deſire to break your late match of running. I conſidered it was Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary for Men of your Age and Quality, to give ſuch Feaſts and Entertainments; but I declare unto you, I cannot endure that you go continually to <hi>Leoſthenes</hi>'s, or that you think of Marrying your ſelf there. No! I would not have even <hi>Cyleſira</hi> make choice of a Man of ſo rude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet a Conduct.</q> Theſe laſt words provoked <hi>Teleander</hi> to the quick, and bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both with Anger and Jealouſie, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
<q>I perceive plainly enough, what Husband of leſs Youth, and more Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you would give <hi>Cyleſira;</hi> but it is well
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103174:19"/>for her, and <hi>Teleander,</hi> that we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon <hi>Aratus.</hi> I will let you ſee the contrary, in what concerns you;</q> replied he with a threatning Voice: Then he went to <hi>Onecryſa</hi>'s, and reproached her with the exceſs of her Indulgence to <hi>Teleander.</hi> The Princeſs of <hi>Erymanthus</hi> did at firſt approve of <hi>Aratus</hi>'s Reaſons; but in a few moments af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Teleander</hi> did efface all the impreſſions they had made. He came to <hi>Onecryſa</hi>'s Chamber, his Face being quite changed, and his Eyes wet with Tears.
<q>Madam, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> I cannot believe that you approve of <hi>Aratu</hi>'s proceedings towards me. He uſes me, as if I were the loweſt of his Slaves; he would put a conſtraint even upon the inclination of my Heart. He cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, that, at my Age, I ſhould have a Paſſion, which he permits in himſelf, when he is ſo far ſtept in years. I doubt not, but that he has prepoſſeſt you againſt me; but he has diſcourſed unto you, much leſs like the Princeſs <hi>Onecryſa</hi>'s Brother, than like <hi>Teleander</hi>'s Rival. To be convinced thereof, you need only examine, what <hi>Aratus</hi> does every minute for <hi>Cyleſira.</hi> You need only obſerve, that he was well enough content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I ſhould contribute to the divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Beautiful Creature, by a Ball, and an imitation of our famous Games, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103174:20"/>yet, that he cannot pardon in me the Paſſion I have for her. I aſſure you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Onecryſa,</hi> I have already made ſome of theſe Reflexions; but after all, <hi>Teleander,</hi> you muſt have ſome Complaiſance for <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> You know how great his Power is in <hi>Achaia;</hi> you ſtand in need of his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, to render you conſiderable; and you may alſo think of making a much more important Alliance, than that with <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> and <hi>Leriana</hi> can be. No, no, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, replied <hi>Teleander,</hi> very much troubled, I will never love any other than <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> and if I loſe the hopes of Marrying her, I ſhall fall into a Languiſhing that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fatal to me. If you would have me live, it muſt be, if you pleaſe, with <hi>Cyleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;</hi> you muſt conſent to it; and you muſt even diſpoſe that admirable Perſon, whom <hi>Aratus</hi> renders Cruel, to be favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to me.</q> 
               <hi>Onecryſa</hi> did, at firſt, with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy enough, deny what <hi>Teleander</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted of her; but the Prince having caſt himſelf at her Feet, did intreat her in ſuch preſſing terms, that ſhe promiſed him, at length, to do what he deſired.</p>
            <p>In a little time after, <hi>Leriana</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> came to viſit her. <hi>Onecryſa</hi> left <hi>Leriana</hi> in her Chamber with <hi>Ariamite,</hi> and took <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſira</hi> aſide into her Cloſet, upon pretence of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103174:20"/>letting her ſee ſome Pictures that were late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought her from <hi>Sycion.</hi> But inſtead of ſhewing her what was beautiful in thoſe pieces; ſhe lookt upon her with attention, and addreſſed her ſpeech to her after this manner.
<q>Fair <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> anſwer me ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I pray you; How do you like the Gentleman, that diverted you yeſterday with the Races and Turnaments? He is ſuch a one, replied <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> as very well deſerves all the tenderneſs you have for him. Do you think, replied <hi>Onecryſa,</hi> that he can render himſelf worthy of yours, and that you can be happy with him? Since, it may be, that I am not ſo much Miſtreſs of my own will, replied <hi>Cyleſira</hi> in bluſhing, as you believe I am, it is not neceſſary, Madam, that I explain my ſelf—Ah, <hi>Cyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſira,</hi> interrupted <hi>Onecryſa</hi> ſpightfully, you explain your ſelf but too much; I clearly perceive what induces you to Contemn <hi>Teleander.</hi> How! Madam, interrupted <hi>Cyleſira</hi> in her turn, do you believe me to be ſo unjuſt, as not to have an eſteem for the good Qualities which all the World attribute to the Prince of <hi>Erymanthus.</hi> That word Eſteem is not at all diſobliging, replied <hi>Onecryſa,</hi> but it contains a certain reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with which I cannot be ſatisfied up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion. I know whence your
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103174:21"/>Sentiments of Coyneſs do proceed; you flatter your ſelf ſo far, as to be perſuaded, that the General of the <hi>Achaians</hi> will Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you, and that is the reaſon you ſcorn what I offer you; but diſabuſe your ſelf, <hi>Cyleſira;</hi> a Man, who has been for ſo many years covered with Glory, will never think of matching himſelf to ſo young a Lady as you are. He would loſe his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation thereby, and you would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve yours. Men would believe that you had been very Complaiſant to eſtabliſh your Fortune; and beſides, what pleaſure could you reliſh with <hi>Aratus?</hi> You might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have for him ſuch a reſpect, as is due to a Father; but could you have that Charming tenderneſs, which, with delight, is felt for a Husband?</q> 
               <hi>Cyleſira</hi> heard the provoked Mother without any emotion; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhe anſwered her in theſe terms, with all the marks of a real ſincerity.
<q>I proteſt to you, Madam, that <hi>Aratus</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are very different from thoſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you believe him capable. We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for the good Offices he does us, to the Recommendation of a conſiderable Friend, which he has in <hi>Peloponeſus;</hi> and <hi>Leriana</hi> owes ſo many, and ſo great Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to that Friend of <hi>Aratus</hi>'s, as that ſhe cannot diſpoſe of me without his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103174:21"/>If you doubt of this, Madam, you need only wait until our departure from <hi>Corinth,</hi> to ſee, that what I tell you is true; and in the mean time I promiſe you, that <hi>Leriana</hi> ſhall not engage me, either to <hi>Aratus,</hi> or to any other. Nevertheleſs, I know not, replied <hi>Onecryſa</hi> ſorrowfully, whether <hi>Teleander</hi> will be able to approve of your reaſon, and to moderate his deſires. He has in his Heart the moſt violent Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ever was. He has not had one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes reſt ſince he ſaw you; and for my own part. I fear his diſquiets will ſhorten my days. I am very ſorry, replied <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> that my preſence has produced ſo ill an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; but Madam, I ſhall depart within a very few days, and you ſhall ſee the cauſe of this diſorder removed. I had much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, replied <hi>Onecryſa,</hi> ſee you toucht with ſome kindneſs for my Son.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Princeſs, taking notice that <hi>Cyleſira</hi> was in a moſt grievous perplexity, thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued her Diſcourſe.
<q>I ſee well enough that this Converſation is not agreeable to you, and that it is not very likely to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in your Heart ſuch Sentiments, as I would have therein for <hi>Teleander.</hi> I leave you <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> and hope you will be more favourable to us, if you make any Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on what I juſt now ſaid unto you.</q> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103174:22"/>theſe words ſhe left <hi>Cyleſira</hi> with <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite</hi> and <hi>Leriana,</hi> and went down into the Garden, where <hi>Teleander</hi> waited for her with extraordinary impatience. She was far from relating to him any thing that might increaſe his Melancholy; ſhe aſſured him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he had a ſhare in <hi>Cyleſira</hi>'s Eſteem; and that he muſt not think, that ſo reſerved a Lady, could be preſt to make, at the very firſt, a more obliging Declaration.</p>
            <p>At this very moment <hi>Onecryſa</hi> was adviſed, that <hi>Themiſtides</hi> deſired to ſee her; ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with all the civility ſhe was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of practiſing at ſuch a Conjuncture; and expreſſed to him, that ſhe had a very earneſt deſire he ſhould be her Son's Friend.
<q>You are very generous, Madam, replied <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> to deſire that the Prince of <hi>Eryman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> may contract a Friendſhip with a Stranger, who may ſtand in need of his ſupport, upon a thouſand occaſions, and in whoſe Power it can never be to make any other requital, than by having good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions towards him. I have had too much experience of what you can do, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Teleander</hi> with a behaviour ſufficiently cold, and the Princeſs <hi>Onecryſa</hi> plainly ſees, it would be dangerous for me to have you my Enemy. Let us talk no more, if you pleaſe, replied <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> of what
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103174:22"/>paſſed yeſterday. I have already proteſted to the Princeſs, that Fortune, according to her Cuſtom, was not favourable to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; but, Sir, ſhe is inconſtant; and I am very glad that the Amity, by which the Princeſs would unite us, may ſecure me from her Changes. You fear her leſs than you expreſs your ſelf, replied <hi>Teleander;</hi> and, for my own part, I am not over appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, that ſhe will always declare her ſelf againſt me.</q> 
               <hi>Onecryſa</hi> perceived that there remained ſtill ſome bitterneſs in <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>'s Spirit; ſo that ſhe deſired to turn the Diſcourſe to ſome other ſubject, when lucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Ariamite, Cyleſira <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion</hi> entred the Garden. They did not dare at firſt to approach <hi>Onecryſa,</hi> having obſerved that there was ſomething ſerious in her Countenance: but in a few moments after, <hi>Ariamite</hi> coming up to them, ſaid, <hi>Do you think it would diſoblige</hi> Themiſtides <hi>and</hi> Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, <hi>to carry them along with us? I believe they would not be very ſorry to quit the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs</hi> Onecryſa<hi>'s Company, for</hi> Cyleſira<hi>'s. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, it is yours,</hi> replied <hi>Cyleſira, that is only capable of making them amends, for what they loſe in leaving the Princeſs.</hi> She had hardly ended theſe words, when <hi>Onecryſa</hi> diſmiſt <hi>Themiſtides</hi> and <hi>Teleander. You would not love me too well,</hi> ſaid ſhe to them, <hi>if I kept
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103174:23"/>you any longer with me. Go your ways along with</hi> Cyleſira <hi>and</hi> Ariamite. <hi>The company of People of my Age cannot long be pleaſing to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the very moment that <hi>Themiſtides</hi> and <hi>Teleander</hi> departed from <hi>Onecryſa, Leriana</hi> and <hi>Philiſtion</hi> came up to her. The two Princes accoſted <hi>Cyleſira</hi> and <hi>Ariamite;</hi> and <hi>Teleander</hi> preſented his hand to the former. <hi>You will be pleaſed,</hi> ſaid he, addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>Cleomenes, to let me lead the admirable</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>and to let the Walking be as favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to me to day, as the Ball was yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day to you. Themiſtides</hi> not being Maſter of the motions of his heart, appeared ſurprized, and looked upon <hi>Teleander</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> with a bluſh. <hi>Ariamite</hi> caſt her Eyes upon <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi>'s Countenance, and having obſerved it changed; <hi>I ſee,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>you are not over-well ſatisfied with this partition. You might eaſily imagine</hi> Teleander <hi>would not chuſe a Siſter.</hi> After theſe words ſhe began to walk, and in a lower voice continued, <hi>I know not whether your loſs be ſo great as you imagine it is. I confeſs that</hi> Cyleſira <hi>has a great deal of Merit and Beauty; but ſhe is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Proud, and it may be even ſaid ſhe is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt. She uſes my Brother after a manner, able to make any other take good heed; and there is mingled with her Modeſty a certain Air of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103174:23"/>greatneſs, for which I know no reaſon.</hi> She was going on with her Diſcourſe, when <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſira,</hi> turning to her, ſaid, <hi>Madam, will you be pleaſed that we repoſe a while on this ſeat of Turfe, which offers it ſelf ſo opportunely? We have walked ſo little,</hi> anſwered <hi>Telean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> very roughly, <hi>that you can be tired with nothing but with hearing me. That is as you pleaſe,</hi> replied ſhe, <hi>I will let you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what you will, provided you will let me ſit down. One need be no great Conjurer,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ariamite</hi> to them, <hi>to know that there is ſome Conteſt between you. If we knew the reaſon of it, we would poſſibly endeavour a reconciliation. But, Madam,</hi> replied <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> with a ſmile, <hi>I know not whether your endeavours would be ſucceſsful, and whether it would not be believed, that you are too much intereſſed for the Prince of</hi> Erymanthus. <hi>'Tis better</hi>—And he was going to propoſe the giving his Hand to <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> but judging Decency would not permit him to do ſo; <hi>'Tis better,</hi> purſued he, <hi>that we advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Princeſs</hi> Onecryſa: <hi>the Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be more peaceable in her preſence.</hi> By that means he would prevent <hi>Teleander</hi> from entertaining <hi>Cyleſira</hi> with his Paſſion. <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite</hi> was alſo of the Opinion to join with <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryſa;</hi> and in going towards the Alley where that Princeſs walked, ſhe diſcourſed again to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103174:24"/>
               <hi>Themiſtides</hi> of <hi>Cyleſira</hi>'s humour, in theſe terms. <hi>Have you not obſerved that Lady's Pride? The Princeſs</hi> Onecryſa <hi>has given her Conſent for my Brother's Eſpouſing her; yet I know that</hi> Cyleſira <hi>tells her, ſhe is under an engagement, which hinders her from accepting of</hi> Teleander. <hi>I confeſs I do not underſtand her Conduct, or rather her Blindneſs. It muſt be that</hi> Cyleſira <hi>pretends to ſome King, ſince ſhe refuſes ſuch a Prince as</hi> Teleander. <hi>But, Madam,</hi> replied <hi>Cleomenes, is it not poſſible for</hi> Cyleſira <hi>to be ingaged in an Alliance, far leſs conſiderable than that which you ſpeak of, and yet keep her word, to the prejudice of her Fortune? I will believe that</hi> Cyleſira <hi>may have leſs Ambition than Generoſity,</hi> repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Ariamite, but you muſt then confeſs, that her Lovers are not the happier, if they attempt a Heart ſo conſtant and immoveable.</hi> Theſe words ſtruck <hi>Cleomenes</hi> with a ſorrow, which he would have had much ado to conceal, if at that time he had not found himſelf near <hi>Onecryſa;</hi> and as that Princeſs, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with her, were all ſufficiently melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Converſation was neither very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, nor very long, but in a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments after the whole Company divided themſelves.</p>
            <p>On the morrow morning <hi>Xenares</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to go wait on <hi>Aratus,</hi> and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103174:24"/>told him he would be glad to bear him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. <hi>You may be aſſured,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>I ſhall approve of this Viſit, as much as I have been troubled at thoſe others I have ſeen you make, ſince they might have been dangerous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. You are pleaſed,</hi> replied <hi>Cleomenes</hi> with impatience, <hi>that I never ſee any thing, but old Generals, old Princes, or old Magiſtrates. Be not paſſionate, I pray,</hi> replied <hi>Xenares, I know what Complaiſance is due to young People; but alſo I am not ignorant with what Precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons their want of Experience ought to be governed. However, let us lay aſide a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which would not be very agreeable unto you. I am unwilling to ſay any thing that may give you vexation, ſince I ſhall ſee you but one day longer, in the ſame City as</hi> Cyleſira. They arriv'd at <hi>Aratus</hi>'s, who received <hi>Cleomenes</hi> with ſeveral marks of Eſteem. <hi>Xenares</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing his ſpeech to the General of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaians,</hi> ſaid, <hi>My Lord,</hi> Themiſtides <hi>will not fail to make uſe of the advantage which For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune offers him, to make his firſt Campaigne under the Great</hi> Aratus. <hi>I aſſure you, I ſhall be very glad of it,</hi> replied that famous Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; <hi>and if</hi> Themiſtides <hi>can find my Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be of any uſe unto him, I will impart them to him with pleaſure. I ſhall ſoon be glad that he will do me the ſame good Office; for I am mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, if he will not proceed far in a little
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103174:25"/>time. Yes, Sir,</hi> replied <hi>Cleomenes, if he can but follow the famous General of the</hi> Achaians; <hi>but that is a Glory wherewith he ought not to flatter himſelf, to what Preſumption ſoever his Youth may tranſport him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a few moments after, the news that were brought, became the ſubject of the Converſation. They were informed, that the <hi>Etolian</hi> Army were preparing to enter <hi>Peloponeſus,</hi> through the Lands of the <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. I think,</hi> anſwered <hi>Aratus,</hi> without being moved, <hi>that they will let us ſee the</hi> Iſthmick <hi>Games, and that King</hi> Agis <hi>will be come with his</hi> Lacedemonians, <hi>before the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies make the Irruption with which they threaten us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> was no ſooner gone from <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> but he thought on the Viſit he did deſign to make to <hi>Cyleſira;</hi> nevertheleſs he thought not on it without a fear, which inclin'd him to take <hi>Philiſtion</hi>'s Advice.
<q>I wiſh with all my Heart, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> that you knew whether <hi>Leriana</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> would take it ill, if I ſhould viſit them this After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> will be able to tell you their Sentiments, and I will gladly govern my ſelf according to his Anſwer. Sir, replied <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> it is not neceſſary to conſult <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſthenes;</hi> you may go viſit <hi>Leriana;</hi> nay after what is paſſed, you cannot decently
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103174:25"/>diſpenſe with your ſelf from going. But conſider that <hi>Leriana</hi> departs within theſe two days; and that if ſhe were to remain longer at <hi>Corinth,</hi> it would not be very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie for you to make her a ſecond Viſit. Ah, <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> replied <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> permit me to reliſh the ſweetneſs which you promiſe me this day, without mingling therewith the bitterneſs you make me fear. We ſhall, perhaps, hereafter find out ſome truſty and cunning Fellow, who ſhall depart with <hi>Leriana,</hi> and come and tell us the place of her retirernent.</q> 
               <hi>Philiſtion</hi> promiſed to find but ſuch a Fellow, and in two hours after he went with him to <hi>Leoſthenes</hi>'s Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leriana</hi> was at that time in her Cloſet, regulating ſome Affairs that concerned her departure; ſo that it happened <hi>Cyleſira</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Cleomenes</hi> and <hi>Philiſtion.</hi> They were handly ſeated, when ſhe addreſſed her ſpeech to <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> and asked him whether he did not find that <hi>Corinth</hi> was one of the faireſt Cities, he had ſeen in all his Travels.
<q>I think, however, <hi>added ſhe,</hi> that you are not generally beloved in this place. The young Gentlemen here cannot bear it, that a Stranger ſhould come and rob them of all the Prizes. I confeſs, Madam, anſwered <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> that I have not been unfortunate; but the Gentlemen, you ſpeak of, eſteem
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103174:26"/>themſelves vanquiſht leſs by <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> than the faireſt Ladies of the Town ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to give place to the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Cyleſira.</hi>
               </q> Theſe laſt words having made that modeſt Creature bluſh, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> examined her Countenance, to ſee whether he could make diſcovery of any thing in it, which he might have cauſe to fear. <hi>Philiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> perceiving them both to be in a little Confuſion, began to ſpeak, in order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them out of it.
<q>I ſee but too plainly, <hi>ſaid he to them, as it were in Anger,</hi> that you both are in the right, and that you both do effectually obſcure the fineſt and the moſt excellent we have in <hi>Corinth;</hi> but my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation on my Countries account is, that both the one and the other are going away. Is then <hi>Themiſtides</hi> about to leave this place? interrupted <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> not being able to endure thoſe Praiſes, wherein ſhe had a ſhare. Yes, Madam, <hi>replied the Prince,</hi> and if Fortune would once more diſpoſe of me into the ſame place as you, I ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem my ſelf more indebted to her for it, than for all the Favours it is in her Power to do me. If that ſhould happen, replied <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> with a ſmile, ſhe would render you a worſe Office than you imagine. But there is no great probability that <hi>Themiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> who, in all appearance, travels
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103174:26"/>only through the faireſt Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> can meet <hi>Cyleſira</hi> in the Solitude whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhe intends to go. Ah, Madam, replied <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> how Charming would that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude be with <hi>Cyleſira;</hi> and how much more pleaſant would I eſteem, than the moſt beautiful Courts of the World.</q> He could not go on, becauſe <hi>Leriana</hi> entred the room; but <hi>Philiſtion</hi> immediately took a pretence to lead her towards the Chamber Windows. <hi>Cyleſira</hi> was afraid leſt <hi>Themiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> ſhould continue a Diſcourſe, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence whereof ſhe durſt not hearken; and caſting her Eyes on <hi>Leriana</hi> and <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> ſhe called out to them; <hi>What! do you leave us? There was no neceſſity, replied</hi> Cleomenes, <hi>of letting me thus know, that my Company a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone was not ſufficient to divert you. I was, Madam, already convinced of it. But why, replied</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>could not I apprehend that mine might be diſagreeable unto you, without the aſſiſtance I now called for? Leriana</hi> and <hi>Philiſtion</hi> being thus drawn near, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained each other with publick News on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, until Decency conſtrained <hi>Themiſtides</hi> to depart. On the morrow <hi>Xenares</hi> carried <hi>Themiſtides</hi> to the Citadel; he made him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine its Fortifications, and in the Evening propoſed to him to go to <hi>Athens. Methinks,</hi> replied <hi>Cleomenes, that, according to what
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103174:27"/>we have been informed of, cancerning the</hi> Eto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, <hi>we ought not to go too far from</hi> Corinth. <hi>'Tis requiſite that we be in a place, where we may have conſtant notice of</hi> Aratus<hi>'s deſignes, and from whence we may be in a poſſibility of joyning with him, as ſoon as there ſhall be occaſion. Well then,</hi> replied <hi>Xenares, we may paſs over into the Iſle of</hi> Egina, <hi>from which we are divided but by ſo ſhort a paſſage. You know how famous it is, as well for the miſchiefs, wherewith 'tis ſaid that the hatred of</hi> Juno <hi>has afflicted it, as for the wonderful change of Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miers into Men, which</hi> Jupiter <hi>made there, at the intreaty of his Son</hi> Eacus. <hi>In the mean time</hi> Philiſtion <hi>ſhall write daily unto us, what it will import us to know. I pray, replied that</hi> Corinthian, <hi>let ſome Friend of mine take upon himſelf that charge, and let me not forſake you. Themiſtides</hi> and <hi>Xenares</hi> accepted his proffer with great acknowledgments, and <hi>Philiſtion</hi> being mindful of what he promiſed <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> inſtructed one of his People, according to the Princes Intentions. He gave him or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to enquire at <hi>Leoſthenes</hi>'s, what way <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> was to take, and commanded him to come with all expedition to give him notice of it, to the Iſle of <hi>Egina,</hi> at the Town of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes, Xenares,</hi> and <hi>Philiſtion</hi> went to embark, followed only by two menial
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103174:27"/>Servants, <hi>Erantor</hi> and <hi>Nicidas,</hi> whom <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nares</hi> had choſen out to ſerve the Prince. While they delayed ſetting Sail, and the People, who were in the Ship, began to murmur, one came to advertiſe the Pilot, that he might depart when he pleaſed, for that the Ladies, whom he expected, would not paſs into <hi>Egina</hi> until to morrow. At the very ſame time <hi>Philiſtion</hi> ſaw the Man arrive, to whom he had given the Order that is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above; and he was informed that <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> did intend to carry <hi>Leriana</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> into <hi>Egina,</hi> to a Houſe which he had at <hi>Palenis. Philiſtion</hi> approacht <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides,</hi> and imparted to him the News he had heard. Then looking upon him with a merry Countenance, ſaid unto him, <hi>Well, Sir, will you now ſay you are unhappy? Will you now complain, when</hi> Cyleſira <hi>comes in ſearch of you? I confeſs, replied</hi> Cleomenes, <hi>that I am well enough contented with this adventure; but,</hi> Philiſtion, <hi>ſince Fortune intermeddles to oblige me, why did ſhe not finiſh her work? VVhy did ſhe not render my happineſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, by placing me in the ſame Ship with</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſira? <hi>VVhat delight it is to be in a poſſibility of beholding every moment what one loves; of converſing with the Charming</hi> Cyleſira; <hi>and of being ſhut up with her in the ſame place! VVhen I think on the Joy I ſhould have had,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103174:28"/>my heart taſts but an imperfect Pleaſure for what you now tell me. It has even a greater incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to regret what it loſes this day, than to flatter it ſelf, with the good Fortune, which you make it hope for to morrow. In fine,</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtion, <hi>we have been too forward in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; and there is, in the unſeaſonableneſs of it, ſomething, I know not what, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes no great good. Is it poſſible, that Love makes a Man always look upon things on the worſt ſide? Muſt you needs be melancholly at ſo fortunate a Chance, becauſe it wanted ſome one particular which you could have deſired? Ah, Sir, if you continue in this humour, you will have many vexatious minutes, during the courſe of your Paſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this manner they diſcourſed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, while they Sailed over the Paſſage. As ſoon as they were Landed in <hi>Egina, Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion</hi> ſhewed <hi>Cleomenes</hi> and <hi>Xenares</hi> the way to the Town of <hi>Palenis,</hi> and took a Lodging near <hi>Leoſthenes</hi>'s Houſe.</p>
            <p>On the morrow he propoſed to <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to go a walking in a Wood, Conſecrated to <hi>Thetis,</hi> which he pointed to with his Hand, it being not above a Bow-ſhoot off.
<q>Do you not obſerve, replied <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> that this Wood advances towards the Coaſt, that lies over againſt the Port of <hi>Pyreum?</hi> We had better turn towards <hi>Corinth.</hi> You ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103174:28"/>ſeen that way yeſterday, replied <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtion</hi> with a ſmile, I was now willing to lead you another. Let us take that which will lead us towards <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> replied <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> impatiently, and confeſs that you have made no good Choice. I know not whether you make a better, replied <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> with a tone more ſerious than before; for, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Sir, if you ſee <hi>Cyleſira</hi> come aſhore, you will, in ſpight of your ſelf, ſhew a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain eagerneſs, mingled with Joy, which will give <hi>Leriana</hi> ſome Jealouſie, and make her very cautious. 'Tis better that the firſt time you meet ſhould be by chance. In fine, Sir, conſider whether you will let me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage your Intereſts, or follow a Paſſion that never is a good Guide.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> ſuffered himſelf to be governed, and <hi>Philiſtion</hi> carried him through <hi>Thetis</hi>'s wood into a Vale, where ſeveral Brooks joyned together, and made a River, whoſe Banks where ſhaded with large Trees: <hi>Well, Sir,</hi> ſaid <hi>Philiſtion, what ſay you to this Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skip? That I ſhould prefer it before the delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Temple of</hi> Theſſaly, <hi>anſwered</hi> Cleomenes, <hi>if I ſaw here</hi> Cyleſira: <hi>But I cannot regard any thing with Pleaſure, when I am away from her I love. Therefore</hi> Philiſtion <hi>let us approach her, I intreat you; ſhe may poſſibly be already arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: We cannot do better than return to</hi> Palenis.</p>

               <hi>Philiſtion</hi> conſented thereunto, and they were hardly within the Town, when they ſaw <hi>Leriana</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> going into <hi>Leoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>'s houſe. <hi>Philiſtion</hi> counterfeited a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, nevertheleſs he advanced forward, and without ſaying many words at the firſt Salutation, he gave his hand to <hi>Leriana,</hi> while <hi>Themiſtides</hi> took <hi>Cyleſira</hi> by her hand.

I being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be far from</hi> Aratus, replied <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, intend to ſtay at</hi> Palenis, <hi>until I muſt march along with him againſt the</hi> Etolians. <hi>But for your part, Madam, I believe that</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſthenes<hi>'s buſineſs will detain you here much longer. I think the contrary,</hi> replied Leria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, <hi>That I ſhall depart from hence very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly: I am not come hither to divert my ſelf, and poſſibly I ſhall neither viſit nor ſee any body, ſo that my ſtay will not appear pleaſant enough, to keep me here any longer, when once my Brother will have given Orders for a Boat that is now repairing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words, and decency, that requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to leave <hi>Leriana</hi> to her repoſe,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103174:29"/>did not permit <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to ſtay any longer with her. As he returned, he was met with by an <hi>Achaian,</hi> who had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and obſerved <hi>Cyleſira</hi> by <hi>Teleander</hi>'s order.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Xenares</hi> was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that <hi>Themiſtides</hi> came out of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſthenes</hi>'s Houſe, and having ſaluted him with an Air, which ſufficiently expreſſed his trouble:
<q>How, Sir, ſaid he, do not you let <hi>Cyleſira</hi> take Breath after her arrival? I perceive, to my deadly ſorrow, that you are fallen into a weakneſs, which you have a thouſand times condemned. Do you think it ſtrange, replied <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> that I ſhould be ſuſceptible of a Paſſion which is ſo common to young People? No Sir, replied <hi>Xenares,</hi> provided it were with a Perſon that were not below your ſelf. You ſee how thoſe Great Men are blamed, who have loved with that inequality. You hear what reproaches are made upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count againſt the Great <hi>Hercules,</hi> whom you acknowledge the Author of your Race. Propoſe to your ſelf the imitation of his brave Actions only, and never mention his faults, to authorize your own. I agree that a King may be allowed to raiſe to his Throne, a Perſon, whom Beauty and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are able to ſupply her want of Noble
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103174:30"/>Extraction. But Sir, is this priviledge to be allowed <hi>You,</hi> during the unhappy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Your Family? You ought as yet to have no other thoughts, than the re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the <hi>King</hi> Your Father; and when you will be a little more advanced in Years, you ſhould chooſe an alliance, that might ſtrengthen your party. I think, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Cleomenes</hi> coldly, I have not yet told you, I would marry <hi>Cyleſira.</hi> I know that I ought not to pretend to it; and that is likely to be the cauſe of the unhappineſs of my whole Life. For to confeſs unto you ingeniouſly, I have a violent paſſion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hopes of overcoming or ſatisfying it. But Sir, replied <hi>Xenares,</hi> can the Son of <hi>Leonidas</hi> condeſcend to love <hi>Leriana</hi>'s Daughter? Is it my fault? The Prince mournfully replied. Can a man love or hate as he pleaſes? And beſides, have you not obſerved how a kind even of Fatali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has drawn me into this unfortunate En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement? You know I went into <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi>'s Garden, with no other intention than to ſee <hi>Ardtus,</hi> when Deſtiny brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the moſt admirable Creature in the World. I am Young: You confeſs that my Temper is hot, and that I loved nothing. Are you then amazed that a Heart not yet poſſeſt with any Paſſion, ſhould receive
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103174:30"/>with joy one ſo Charming? Nevertheleſs aſſure your ſelf, I depend upon a Father, and the War is going to ſeparate me from <hi>Cyleſira.</hi> Only I could wiſh, that I were allowed ſometimes to viſit that fair Lady, while we ſhall ſtay at <hi>Egina.</hi> I ſhall not give you often that vexation; for <hi>Leriana</hi> is not of an humour to receive too frequent viſits.</q> 
               <hi>Xenares</hi> muſed for ſome Moments, and afterwards conſented to what <hi>Cleomenes</hi> deſired.
<q>But, Sir, <hi>added he,</hi> it is upon Condition that we depart within a Week for the Camp of the <hi>Achaians.</hi> That dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence does become very well Perſons of your Age. And beſides, it is convenient, that when <hi>Aratus</hi> ſhall arrive at the Army, he finds you already accuſtomed to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions of Men of War.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He ſaid no more; but left <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtaying for his Anſwer. The Prince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated <hi>Philiſtion</hi> to ſee <hi>Leoſthenes,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that leave might be obtained from him ſometimes to go to his Houſe. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſthenes</hi> gave it; but he was ſurprized when he ſpoke of it to his Siſter. <hi>I intreat you,</hi> ſaid <hi>Leriana</hi> to him, <hi>never to refolv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103174:31"/>ſhe ſhould think convenient; but that he did not believe there had been any myſtery in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving thoſe Viſits in the Countrey, which had not been refuſed at</hi> Corinth. <hi>Believe me, Siſter,</hi> added he, <hi>you ought not to affect theſe Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities upon occaſions, which the commerce of Life renders ſo uſual; otherwiſe it may be ſaid that my Nieces Beauty makes you too proud and diſdainful.</hi> At length <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> perſuaded <hi>Leriana,</hi> and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> viſited <hi>Cyleſira.</hi> He was over joy'd to give her the little Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his Complaiſance and Submiſſion; to look upon her with a paſſionate Air, to meet ſometimes her Eyes, and never to ſee any mark of Averſion! upon her Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. In the mean time <hi>Teleander</hi> was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that <hi>Themiſtides</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> were in the Iſle of <hi>Egina:</hi> He did not doubt, but that their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was concerted between them, and ceived the upon a mortal Griel. He failed to be preſent at a Horſe race, wherein he had promiſed to make one. For the violent agitation of his Heart put him into a Fever. He was forced to betake himſelf to his Bed, and <hi>Oneeryſa,</hi> upon her firſt hearing the News, ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> unto him all in a fright. As ſoon as <hi>Title ander</hi> ſaw her, he addreſſed his ſpeech unto her, ſaying; <hi>Ah! Madam, I muſt dye, unleſs I will ſee.</hi> Themiſtides <hi>the Poſſeſſor of</hi> Cyleſira. <hi>But, Son,</hi> replied <hi>Onecryſa, what
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103174:31"/>aſſurance have you of his good Fortune? Will you, upon ſome ſimple Conjecture, abandon your ſelf to deſpair? My unhappineſs is certain, replied</hi> Teleander. <hi>Two Perſons, ſuch as</hi> Cyleſira <hi>and</hi> Themiſtides, <hi>have not left</hi> Corinth <hi>to go into</hi> Egina, <hi>without having ſome conſiderable reaſon for it.</hi> Xenares <hi>and</hi> Leriana <hi>have not managed that Voyage with ſo much myſtery, without ſome deſign, that could have merited ſuch a Conduct. No, no, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I have no room to doubt of my misfortune; but inſtead of ſpending my time in unprofitable Lamentations, I muſt go and pierce my Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val's Heart, and take away</hi> Cyleſira <hi>from him by force. In fine, there is no reſolution that I will non take, in order to unite my ſelf to the faireſt Creature that ever was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He would afterwards have given ſome or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that concerned his departure, when <hi>Onecryſa,</hi> not judging that he was in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to undertake a Voyage, did at firſt oppoſe his Intentions. But at length ſhe was conſtrained to conſent to them, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs upon Condition, that ſhe ſhould go along with him, being unwilling to abandon <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> in the condition and reſolution wherein ſhe ſaw him.
<q>Ah, Madam, <hi>cried he out,</hi> how much ſhould I be obliged unto you, if you would grant me the aſſiſtance you can give! My Life and Death are in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103174:32"/>your hands. It is in your Power to give me <hi>Cyleſira.</hi> In mine! replied <hi>Onecryſa</hi> with amazement. Even in yours, added <hi>Teleander,</hi> for indeed there is nothing eaſier than for you to carry out <hi>Cyleſira</hi> to take the Air in your Chariot, to remove her far enough of from <hi>Leriana</hi> and <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> and to carry her into a place, where I may be able to move her heart by my ſubmiſſion and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance. How! interrupted <hi>Onecryſa</hi> would you carry away <hi>Cyleſira</hi> by force and dare you propoſe to me to be the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complice of your Crime? When I deſired you would be preſent, replied <hi>Teleander,</hi> have I pretended to commit any action, that you could diſ-approve of, and of which <hi>Cyleſira</hi> her ſelf could have reaſon to complain? We ſhould conſtrain only to accept of an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which Fortune offers her. If at firſt ſhe may utter a few Complaints againſt us, we ſhall hereafter receive nothing but thanks. Nevertheleſs, replied <hi>Onecryſa,</hi> you had better make a Tryal of ſome other ways: They would be too far about, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Teleander,</hi> I do not ſee they could bring me to the place I would go to, before <hi>Themiſtides</hi> arrive there. But who has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded you, that that Stranger is beloved? replied <hi>Onecryſa.</hi> I never perceived <hi>Leriana</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> entertain him too favourably.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103174:32"/>A Man muſt be in love, replied <hi>Teleander</hi> to have Eyes quick and penetrating into theſe kinds of occaſions. However, if I am miſtaken, I am willing to act no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then according to your Orders. But, Madam, if I let you ſee that I am in the right, will you then refuſe me the aſſiſtance which I deſire of you? I am ſo thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuaded, that your Conjectures are falſe, replied <hi>Onecryſa,</hi> that I run no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of hazzard, in promiſing to comply with this that you now deſire.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She departed from him, and thought that the promiſe ſhe had given, had engaged her to nothing; but <hi>Teleander</hi> was not of the ſame Opinion. He felt a great part of his diſquiets growing calm, now when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to imagine, that by <hi>Onecryſa</hi>'s ſupport, he ſhould have yet time enough to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Project of <hi>Themiſtides</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira.</hi> This thought having ſet his Heart ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at reſt, put him in a Condition to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part on the morrow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Onecryſa,</hi> inſtead of conteſting with him to no purpoſe, left her Daughter <hi>Ariamite</hi> with <hi>Aratus,</hi> and told them both, ſhe was very deſirous to viſit <hi>Leriana</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> in their Solitude. <hi>I aſſure you,</hi> continued ſhe, <hi>that I am weary of theſe Feſtivals and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days; and beſides, I ſhall be very glad to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:103174:33"/>Teleander <hi>far from theſe violent Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which he loves a little too well for his health.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aratus</hi> did not diſapprove of this deſign, and <hi>Onecryſa</hi> put it into Execution. During their Journey <hi>Teleander</hi> thought of nothing, but on the means of finding out the certainty of his Conjectures. He being in the Coach with <hi>Onecryſa,</hi> and conſequently having an opportunity of diſcourſing every minute with her, ſaid, <hi>Madam, if you would conceal, for a little while at the firſt, your arrival at</hi> Egina, Xenares <hi>and</hi> Leriana <hi>would let</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtides <hi>and</hi> Cyleſira <hi>act with leſs Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, and it would be eaſier for us to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that which we have a mind to know. But if, on the contrary, you go preſently to alight at</hi> Leoſthenes<hi>'s Houſe, they will not fail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their Cautions, and to continue the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they have begun. Son, replied</hi> Onecryſa, <hi>I am very willing to comply with you in that matter, and even to leave entirely to you, the Conduct of a Journey, I have undertaken only for your ſake. But once more I tell you, your ſuſpicions are ill grounded; and I am much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, if</hi> Cyleſira <hi>loves</hi> Themiſtides. <hi>I wiſh, with all my heart, replied</hi> Teleander, <hi>that I might ſee my ſelf in a miſtake; but inſtead of flattering my ſelf with that hope, I had rather, without any delay, take ſuch meaſures, as may
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103174:33"/>make my deſign ſucceed. I have heard it ſaid, that there is a pleaſant Wood near</hi> Leoſthenes<hi>'s Houſe, you may repoſe there an hour or two, and hear a great deal of news in a little time. You need only ſend, on ſeveral pretences, ſome Inhabitants of</hi> Palenis <hi>to the Domeſtick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of</hi> Xenares <hi>and</hi> Leriana, <hi>and they will not fail to inform you of every thing that paſſes amongſt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While <hi>Teleander</hi> is thus preparing to go through with his Reſolution, <hi>Themiſtides</hi> is far from enjoying that good Fortune, which gives ſo many ſuſpicions. All the advantage he has, is that of being in the ſame place as <hi>Cyleſira;</hi> yet he is not much the happier for it. He very ſeldom obtains permiſſion to ſee the Object of his Love. <hi>Leriana</hi> makes it known, that ſhe is not come to <hi>Egina</hi> to be ſeen by every body. On the other ſide, <hi>Xenares,</hi> inſtead of oppoſing <hi>Cleomenes</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly in the firſt tranſports of his Paſſion, reſolved to addreſs himſelf to <hi>Leriana,</hi> to intreat her not to receive any Viſits from <hi>Themiſtides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the morrow, as he ſent to ask whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he might wait on <hi>Leriana;</hi> ſhe anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Man who brought the Meſſage; <hi>I pray tell</hi> Xenares, <hi>that I have no leſs deſire to ſpeak with him; and becauſe we may not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, we had better meet in</hi> Thetis<hi>'s
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103174:34"/>Wood in the great Walk there.</hi> It was juſt at that nick of time that <hi>Onecryſa</hi> arrived near <hi>Palenis,</hi> and having left her Chariot and Attendants, at an houſe ſome diſtance off the Town, Chance brought her to that part of the Wood, where <hi>Xenares</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> were to meet. <hi>Teleander</hi> met with a young Fellow, whom he found ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for his Deſign. He gave him the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Inſtructions, and ſent him to <hi>Cyleſira</hi>'s and <hi>Themiſtides</hi>'s Lodgings. This Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger acquitted himſelf dexterouſly of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and in a few minutes after brought back notice, that <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> was gone to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and that <hi>Xenares</hi> and <hi>Leriana</hi> were juſt a coming into the Wood, to diſcourſe together of ſome very conſiderable buſineſs. <hi>Ha! Madam, ſaid</hi> Teleander, <hi>hide your ſelf, if you are ſeen, you may ſay laughingly, that you had a mind to ſurprize</hi> Leriana; <hi>and if we eſcape without being perceived; we ſhall poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be informed of the myſtery which we deſire to know. Onecryſa</hi> conſented to it, and <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> ſearcht for ſome place, that might fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour his Intentions. He had hardly found one, when <hi>Xenares</hi> and <hi>Leriana</hi> came into the Wood by two ſeveral ways, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced towards one another. <hi>Teleander</hi> could not look upon them without an extraordinary emotion of Heart, and what added very
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103174:34"/>much to his vexation was, that <hi>Xenares</hi> and <hi>Leriana</hi> were at ſome diſtance from the place where he was, and turned their backs towards it, ſo that he could neither over-hear them, nor conſult their Countenances. In the mean time <hi>Xenares</hi> beginning the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, ſaid, <hi>Will you, Madam, be pleaſed, before I tell you the cauſe that brings me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, inform me, what Commands you have for me. I am willing, anſwered</hi> Leriana, <hi>to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain my ſelf firſt; and that I may loſe no time in making vain Apologies, I ſhall only intreat you to hinder</hi> Themiſtides <hi>to come to my Houſe. I have very forcible Reaſons that forbid me to ſuffer it. I have alſo very important Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, replied</hi> Xenares, <hi>which inſpire me with the ſame Sentiments.</hi> Themiſtides <hi>muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn free into his own Country, and it would be difficult for him to preſerve his Liberty, near ſuch a Perſon as</hi> Cyleſira <hi>is. How glad am I, replied</hi> Leriana, <hi>that we have the ſame Intereſts; by acting thus unanimouſly, we ſhall prevent</hi> Themiſtides <hi>and</hi> Cyleſira <hi>from being in love with each other, and if they are already in love, their engagement will not be able to hold againſt the meaſures we ſhall take.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ending theſe words ſhe found her ſelf at the end of the Walk, and took another that led directly towards <hi>Teleander</hi> and <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryſa.</hi> Her mind being then at reſt, as well
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103174:35"/>as <hi>Xenares,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Erymanthus</hi> failed not to attribute the ſatisfaction he obſerved in their Faces, to the Cauſe his Jealouſie ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to him: So that his deſpair augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a ſtrange manner; eſpecially when he heard <hi>Leriana</hi> go on with her Diſcourſe in theſe terms. <hi>I am very glad we are of the ſame Opinion: We ſhall have no more of thoſe diſquiets, that we have had upon</hi> Themiſtides <hi>and</hi> Cyleſira<hi>'s ſcore. But, Madam, replied</hi> Xenares, <hi>let us ſay nothing, I intreat you, of the Reſolution which we have now taken. 'Tis very material, that none ſhould know it. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on my Diſcretion, replied</hi> Leriana, <hi>and be aſſured, that</hi> Cyleſira <hi>will follow my. Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Yes,</hi> Xenares, <hi>I will anſwer for her; methinks this is enough to ſend you back con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, they parted, and went out of the Wood, and left <hi>Teleander</hi> in a mortal Melancholly. The Prince turned himſelf towards <hi>Onecryſa,</hi> and beholding her with Eyes, that ſufficiently denoted the trouble of his Heart, he ſaid, <hi>Well, Madam, will you ſtill affirm I am miſtaken; and that they do not intend to rob me of</hi> Cyleſira? <hi>I confeſs,</hi> anſwered <hi>Onecryſa, that my ſurprize is extream. I could never have believed that</hi> Cyleſira <hi>had been thus engaged, as</hi> Leriana <hi>lets us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſhe is. However, replied</hi> Teleander,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103174:35"/>
               <hi>it ſhall not be eaſie for her to unite her ſelf to that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown, whom ſhe prefers before we; or at leaſt I will not be ſo unhappy as to ſee that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion. It ſhall either coſt me my Life, or I will reach</hi> Themiſtides<hi>'s Heart. I will attack him even before</hi> Cyleſira<hi>'s Eyes. But, replied</hi> Onecryſa <hi>all in a fright, what neceſſity is there that you expoſe your ſelf after that manner? If you chance to overcome your Rival, do you think you ſhall be received with the greater favour, by the Perſon who loves him? And if your ſelf be overcome, will you not give your Enemies a freſh cauſe of Joy and Triumph? You had better,</hi> Teleander, <hi>you had better take a way more pleaſing, and leſs dangerous. Let us ſeize</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>as you at firſt propoſed unto me; I conſent to it. You will be every minute furniſhed with means to make your ſelf be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by her, when her dependance ſhall be on us, and ſhe removed from</hi> Themiſtides. <hi>If you cannot gain her Heart, at leaſt ſhe ſhall not have the liberty to give her ſelf to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They then conſulted of the means how to execute their Reſolution. They re-took their Chariot, and went directly to <hi>Leoſthenes</hi>'s Houſe, as if they had but juſt then arrived at <hi>Palenis. Leriana</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> received them with Civility, accompanied with Friendſhip and Reſpect, and gave them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103174:36"/>quickly an Entertainment, wherein they ſaw plenty of Dainties, proper to good Country Towns.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Teleander</hi> enjoyed the pleaſure of eating with <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> of looking on her with Eyes full of Paſſion, and of finding her all Mild and Complaiſant, <hi>Themiſtides</hi> was diſturbed with cruel diſquiets. Beſides his being informed that his Rival was with <hi>Cyleſira, Xenares</hi> told him News much more vexatious. He gave an account of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty <hi>Leriana</hi> had made him, and aſſured him he would diſoblige <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> if he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſee her any more. <hi>The Reaſons ſhe has to forbid your going to her Houſe,</hi> purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, <hi>are poſſibly greater than I believed them at firſt to be. Not to flatter you, Sir, I doubt that</hi> Onecryſa <hi>and</hi> Teleander <hi>would not, during the Games, have quitted</hi> Corinth, <hi>to come into</hi> Egina, <hi>if they had had no other buſineſs, than to make a formal Viſit. That which confirms me more in my Conjectures is, that they oblige me to make you this diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Compliment, preciſely at the time your Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val is expected. Will you then, after this, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay one minute, to diſingage your ſelf? Will you not open your Eyes, to ſee that</hi> Telean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>is preferred before you? But, ſhould</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſira <hi>do otherwiſe, what advantage could you reap from it? Would you marry an unknown
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103174:36"/>Woman? You, Sir, who one day are to reign o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the fierceſt Nations of the World? Court ſome Alliance that may contribute to the Peace of the Common-wealth, or elſe ſtrengthen your Party. Joyn Ambition to your Love. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the Princeſs</hi> Agiatis <hi>is a moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht Beauty, and that your marriage with her would unite the two Royal Families of</hi> Sparta. <hi>I know very well ſhe is deſigned for King</hi> Agis; <hi>but, Sir, that Prince is your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and it would be an action worthy of your greatneſs, to attempt to win of him a double Victory; I mean to vanquiſh him at the head of a Powerful Faction, and in the Heart of a Charming Princeſs. This indeed is to require very much from you, but is it too much for a Prince, that derives his Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from the great</hi> Hercules? <hi>No,</hi> Xenares, <hi>replied</hi> Themiſtides <hi>animated with a Noble Ardour, it is not too much for</hi> Cleomenes, <hi>to attack</hi> Agis, <hi>though ſupported by a Party much ſtronger than that of</hi> Leonidas, <hi>but never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that I will endeavour to rob him of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giatis. <hi>For beſides, that the Princeſs would never favour my enterpriſe, and</hi> Gilipus <hi>would be much more averſe unto me; I, for my own part, confeſs unto you, that I ſhould not care to combat with thoſe Sentiments of averſion, wherewith they have inſpired</hi> Agia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, <hi>for every thing that has relation to the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103174:37"/>Houſe of</hi> Leonidas. <hi>You know, Sir, replied</hi> Xenares, <hi>that Great Men change their Love or Hate, according to the change of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. 'Tis not the pretended Averſion of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giatis, <hi>that creates in you that indifference for her; I know the real cauſe of it. You no longer remember who you are; and I perceive, with a feeling ſorrow, that 'tis</hi> Cyleſira <hi>who has made you forget your ſelf. But, Sir, make a generous effort, and forget even her. Rouſe up in your Heart a juſt reſentment, for the Prohibition I made you in her behalf. Maſter your ſelf ſo far this day, as to be able to go and divert your ſelf with Hunting, without any regret for her: To morrow you ſhall make ſome other progreſs, and ſo, by degrees, free your ſelf of a Paſſion, which otherwiſe would be fatal to your Repoſe, to the re-eſtabliſhment of your Houſe, and to your Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Themiſtides</hi> ſighed inſtead of anſwering. His Love was too violent; and <hi>Xenares</hi>'s Arguments were a little too ſtrong, not to give him moſt ſevere Torments. He was, for a while, as it were buried in a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Melancholly; but at length he made this anſwer.
<q>I have hearkned to your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, with all the acknowledgment that I ought; but, <hi>Xenares,</hi> I know not whether I ſhall be capable of following it. Methinks I ſhould not go to divert my ſelf out of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenis,</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:103174:37"/>ſince even Decency requires that I make a viſit to the Princeſs <hi>Onecryſa.</hi> Ah! Sir, anſwered <hi>Xenares</hi> with vexation, do not cover, under that pretence, the deſire you have to ſee <hi>Cyleſira.</hi> Do you believe, that, after what I told you, you would do <hi>Onecryſa</hi> or <hi>Leriana</hi> any pleaſure, by going to <hi>Leoſthenes</hi>'s Houſe, at a time when your preſence there is the moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended? Is it after that manner that you pretend to make your ſelf be beloved? In the name of Heaven, think of gaining the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of the World, and never ſhew your ſelf incommode. I leave you with <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtion,</hi> added he, ſeeing that <hi>Corinthian</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and go to give ſome neceſſary Orders; for the matter I propoſed unto you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He was hardly gone out, when <hi>Themiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> related to <hi>Philiſtion</hi> his misfortune in a few words, and going on with the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
<q>Can you, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> be of <hi>Xenares</hi> Opinion? Ought I to remove from <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> at the very minute, on which her Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and mine will poſſibly be decided, For, indeed, my Lot is affixed to that Charming Creatures. I will never love any but her. All my Paſſions are ſo ſubjected to my love, that I more ardently wiſh for the re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the King my Father, and have a greater deſire, than ever, to ſignalize my
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103174:38"/>ſelf, only that I may be more worthy of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſira.</hi> I confeſs anſwered <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> that the fair Lady deſerves the Eſteem, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Admiration of all the Earth. But, Sir, is a Prince of your Rank allowed to take to Wife the firſt Lady that pleaſes him? Is he not obliged to regard his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, rather than the ſatisfaction of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. I know, interrupted <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> with Impatience, that Morality and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy would furniſh you with much more advice to give me; but I do not, at this time of the day, deſire Counſel of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Tell me freely, <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> what can I promiſe to my ſelf from your Friendſhip? All things, <hi>replied he;</hi> and if I find an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to expoſe my Life for you, I ſhall do it more joyfully, than render you the little Services, wherewith your love is ſatisfied. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> embraced <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> and thanked him. I muſt, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> know what is done at <hi>Leriana</hi>'s, and whether it be true, that <hi>Teleander</hi> is come to marry <hi>Cyleſira.</hi> You may be aſſured, I ſhall attempt all ways that will be poſſible to croſs his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He had hardly finiſhed theſe words, when the Prince of <hi>Erymanthus</hi> paſſed before his Houſe in <hi>Onecryſa</hi>'s Chariot. He deſired to ſhew himſelf to his Rival, on purpoſe to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103174:38"/>allay his ſuſpicions. When <hi>Cleomenes</hi> ſaw him, he was very much ſurprized, and being leſs me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly than before, he cried out;
<q>How! can it be poſſible that <hi>Teleander</hi> ſhould be returning back again? 'Tis apparently ſo, ſaid <hi>Philiſtion.</hi> I effectually believe, that the Prince of <hi>Erymanthus</hi> was deſirous of accompanying <hi>Onecryſa</hi> to viſit <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> and finding that fair Creature no leſs ſevere at <hi>Palenis,</hi> than ſhe had been at <hi>Corinth,</hi> vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes him go and croſs the Water back again. What you tell me is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, anſwered <hi>Cleomenes;</hi> but ſhall not I have a certain and more clear Information of it? Cannot you go and viſit <hi>Onecryſa?</hi> I will go, if you command me, replied <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtion.</hi> Nevertheleſs, Sir, I am unwilling to do it, until I have put you in mind of the Prohibition they have made you, and the match of Hunting, <hi>Xenares</hi> even now propoſed unto you. Thoſe prohibitions, replied <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> have no relation, either to <hi>Onecryſa</hi> or your ſelf, and as for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement of Hunting, wherein <hi>Xenares</hi> does pretend to engage me, nothing is ſo eaſie as to defer it for ſome moments.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> without any more ado, went to pay the Princeſs of <hi>Erymanthus</hi> a viſit, and being informed that ſhe would go a walking with <hi>Cyleſira</hi> alone, into the Wood, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:103174:39"/>and went to give <hi>Themiſtides</hi> an account of it.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Xenares</hi> had given or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to <hi>Erantor,</hi> to lead three Horſes to <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> and to carry with him Bows, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and Javelines. The Prince mounts on Horſe-back, and takes the Arms that were preſented him, and, followed by <hi>Philiſtion</hi> and <hi>Erantor,</hi> he entered into the Wood, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

As ſoon as he was in the moſt unfrequented part of the Thicket, he alighted, and gave the Horſes to <hi>Erantor</hi> to hold, and walked on foot with <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> to diſcourſe of his Paſſion and Misfortune. He went towards thoſe places, where he believed he might chance to ſee <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> and looked every where with ſo much care, that at length he diſcovered on the out-ſide of the Wood, two Women diſcourſing together, and ſitting upon the Graſs. He advanced towards them as ſoftly as he could; and notwithſtanding their backs were towards him, yet he did not fail t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> know them for <hi>Onecryſa</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira.</hi> He was ſufficiently moved at this ſight, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached near enough to over-hear them. He heard the Princeſs of <hi>Erymanthus</hi> going on with her Diſcourſe after this manner.
<q>Fair <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> I conjure you not to think ſtrange, what I am going to tell you, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103174:39"/>give me any interruption. 'Tis not without an infinite deal of trouble, that I ſhall ſee the Execution of a deſign, which you will at firſt condemn, and yet, in the Conſequence, it will poſſibly make your Fortune. But, indeed, <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> I was in that extremity, that I muſt either have ſeen a Son, who is dear unto me, languiſh and die, or elſe have overcome the reluctancy, which I had for an enterprize he propoſed unto me. I did, indeed, eſteem it Criminal at the firſt; but I have afterwards conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, as the only remedy that could be applied to <hi>Teleander</hi>'s Deſpair. That Prince has not been able to endure the indifference you have had for him, and has taken notice, with a double augmentation of ſorrow, that <hi>Themiſtides</hi> was entertained after a more obliging manner. In the mean time, a Man unknown; did not, perhaps, deſerve that preference; but you will be more juſt, when <hi>Teleander</hi> ſhall have removed you from his Rival.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At theſe words <hi>Cleomenes</hi> felt a ſtrange Emotion. He whiſpered <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> that he ſhould go, and cauſe the Horſes to the brought to him; and afterwards he heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the ſame attention, as he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <pb n="80" facs="tcp:103174:40"/>
            <p>
               <hi>However, be not afraid,</hi> ſaid Onecryſa, <hi>tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Madam, is it poſſible;</hi> replied Cyleſira then, with ſurpriſe; <hi>that it is the Princeſs</hi> Erymanthus, <hi>who talks thus unto me? Is it the Siſter of the Illuſtrious</hi> Aratus, <hi>that is become an Accomplice of</hi> Teleander's <hi>Extravagances? 'Tis a Mother, that would ſave a Sons life,</hi> replied Onecryſa; <hi>for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>I know more than I could wiſh I did, and than you imagine. In the mean time, I love you ſtill enough, to render you happy in ſpight of your ſelf. Is it, by depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me of liberty?</hi> replied Cyleſira, with a Voice ſomething lowder: <hi>Is it, by making me</hi> Teleander's <hi>Slave?</hi> Teleander's <hi>Slave!</hi> cried out that Prince, in diſcovering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, all on the ſudden, <hi>You know, Madam, that you ſhall be abſolute Miſtreſs every where, where I have any Power. You have nothing elſe to do, but to aſcend into that Charriot;</hi> added he, in ſhewing Onecryſa's Charriot, that began to appear. How, <hi>Telander!</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted <hi>Cyleſira; are you not afraid to provoke the Great</hi> Aratus? <hi>I am afraid of nothing, but of loſing you,</hi> replied the Prince; <hi>and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded I be near you, and you far from my Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, I know no reaſon I have, to fear any
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:103174:40"/>thing. But, Madam,</hi> continued he, in giving her his hand; <hi>aſcend if you pleaſe, and do not make me loſe a Time, which it imports me very much to uſe well. I mind you once more, O Prince, replied</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>to conſider through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with your ſelf, that this Action does offend me, and caſts a blemiſh on your own Glory. I pray do not compleat your Crime, and I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don you all that you have done to this Hour. I will reſtore you my Eſteem and Friendſhip: I will even add thereunto, a ſenſe of gratitude, for the Complaiſance you ſhall have towards me.</hi>
               <q>Upon all other occaſions, Madam, replied <hi>Teleander,</hi> I am ready to follow your Sentiments; but you ſhall, if you pleaſe, follow mine upon this.</q> In ending theſe words, he took her by the hand, and with the aſſiſtance of his two Gentlemen, he made her aſcend the Charriot, and ſit neer <hi>Onecryſa. Cyleſira</hi> was not tranſported with any Paſſion, but having looked fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the Prince of <hi>Erimanthus,</hi>
               <q>
                  <hi>Teleander,</hi> ſaid ſhe, you know not whom you have to deal with, and were I of a humor to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, I could make you fear—Whom, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, interrupted he, your <hi>Themiſtides?</hi> If <hi>Themiſtides</hi> were here, replied <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> you would not poſſibly put into Execution this your enterpriſe, againſt a helpleſs Woman.</q> Theſe words being heard by <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:103174:41"/>gave him a ſenſible joy; and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the fervency he had to deliver <hi>Cyleſtra.</hi> In that moment, <hi>Teleander</hi> begins to march forward, followed by the Charriot; and <hi>Themiſtides</hi> is upon the point of dying, with impatience and deſpair. But at length he found his moſt violent Torments grow ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier. His Eyes being continually turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Place, from whence <hi>Themiſtides</hi> was to return, he perceived him preſently through the Trees, he runs unto him, leaps a Horſe-back, and purſues after <hi>Teleander</hi> with ſo much ſpeed, that he ſoon overtakes the <hi>Charriot.</hi> Hold, cried he out immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to him who drove it. Hold, or thou driveſt to thy death. That Man frightned with theſe threats, did not fail to obey him, when <hi>Teleander</hi> being turned about, and knowing <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> advanced towards him, with his Sword in his Hand, and ſaid to him, hold your ſelf. <hi>Set then at liberty, interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> Cleomenes <hi>fiercely, a Perſon, whom all the Earth ought to reſpect.</hi> Inſtead of continuing their diſcourſe, they began a Combat that ſoon became bloody. The four Horſemen ran to <hi>Teleander's</hi> Aſſiſtance, and Philiſtion and <hi>Erantor</hi> ranged themſelves by <hi>Themiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> ſide; <hi>Onecryſa,</hi> allarmed for a Son whom ſhe tenderly loved, cried out, that they ſhould carry back <hi>Cyleſira</hi> to <hi>Leriana</hi>'s, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:103174:41"/>alighted out of the Charriot, to part ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a fray. <hi>Cyleſira</hi> would alſo have alighted, when ſhe ſaw <hi>Teleander</hi> falling ſuddenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, with little probability of life, and <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> all covered with Blood, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing towards her, with a greater fear of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing her, than he needed to have had, after having rendred her ſuch a piece of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
<q>Madam, ſaid he unto her, very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully, the prohibition that was made me in your Name, would have hindred me, from preſenting my ſelf before you, had I not believed, I ſhould have been in ſome meaſure ſerviceable unto you on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. She made anſwer, How generous are you, <hi>Themiſtides?</hi> And how unfortunate am I?</q> She added theſe laſt words, in a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Voice, not to be heard; and at the ſame time looked upon <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> with eyes fully expreſſing her acknowledgment. <hi>Themiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> perceiving nothing, but what was very obliging, in <hi>Cyleſira</hi>'s Countenance, felt a kind of joy, whereof his heart had never before been ſenſible; and what added yet to his pleaſure, was, that he ſaw himſelf in ſuch a Condition, as to be able himſelf to carry <hi>Cyleſira</hi> back to <hi>Leoſthenes</hi>'s Houſe, and to reſtore her to <hi>Leriana,</hi> of whom he had reaſon to complain. In effect, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted from his Horſe, and in ſpight of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103174:42"/>two wounds he had received, he went up into the <hi>Charioteer</hi>'s Seat, and took the way towards <hi>Palenis.</hi>
               <q>Ah <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> what are you going to do? cried out <hi>Cyleſira;</hi> is it thus you take care for your own preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? Have you not put your ſelf into enough of Danger? Muſt you again expoſe your life? I could not loſe it, with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Glory, than in ſerving you, replied <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omenes;</hi> and ſince it is ſo, Madam, what care ought I to take of it, when it is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red I ſhould paſs it without ſeeing you?</q> As ſoon as <hi>Themiſtides</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> were arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Leoſthenes</hi>'s Houſe, <hi>Leriana</hi> beheld them with a ſurpriſe impoſſible to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. She could not comprehend how <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſira,</hi> who went out on foot with <hi>Onecryſa,</hi> ſhould come back in a Charriot with <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtides.</hi> She knew not why the Charriot, which ſhe thought <hi>Teleander</hi> was to make uſe of in his return, ſhould come back with that Prince; why <hi>Themiſtides</hi> drove it himſelf; and in fine, why he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and covered with Blood. But her won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der augmented in a very ſtrange manner, when they related to her what had hapned. She could not forbear fretting at the Attempt, and as ſhe was ſenſible, that the Obligation ſhe had for <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> was much greater than that Prince could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103174:42"/>ſo ſhe gave him more marks of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement than he expected from her.
<q>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, if Glory, the follower of all brave Actions, were not the ſureſt reward of them, you would find but an ill recompence for this that you have now done: For indeed, what is it I can do for the man, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores to me <hi>Cyleſira?</hi> Permit him to come ſometimes to your Houſe, replied <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> and then <hi>Themiſtides</hi> himſelf will be your Debtor.</q> He pronounced theſe words with an air ſo tender, and reſpectful, that <hi>Leriana</hi> began to grow melancholly upon them, fearing leſt they ſhould make ſome impreſſion in <hi>Cyleſira's</hi> Soul. Nevertheleſs, inſtead of making any demonſtration of her diſquier, ſhe endeavoured to put an end handſomly to the Converſation. <hi>Themiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>go and take ſome repoſe, take care for nothing, but for the recovery of your Health: I ſhall perhaps do more than you expect from my Gratitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> ſatisfied with this hope that was given him, returned home, and <hi>Xenares</hi> had no ſooner obſerved that he was all bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but he felt a ſorrow for it, that came very near to deſpair. While he was ſending for a Chyrurgeon, <hi>Philiſtion</hi> arrived, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by <hi>Erantor.</hi> They were both woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103174:43"/>but their Wounds, as well as <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>'s, were not dangerous. <hi>Xenares</hi> did then moderate his affliction, and writ to <hi>Leonidas</hi> to give him an account of what the Prince had done.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> arrives, and he is hardly informed of what had paſſed, but he teſtifies his ſurprize, and his vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Leriana.</hi>
               <q>How Siſter, ſaid he, do you refuſe <hi>Cyleſira</hi> to <hi>Teleander,</hi> and do you reduce that Prince to the neceſſity of carrying her away by force? You are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, if it be for King <hi>Seleucus,</hi> that you keep your Daughter; or if King <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy</hi> would make her Queen of <hi>Egypt.</hi> I intreat you to tell me, what are your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and impart unto me a Secret, wherein you know I ought to have ſome intereſt? I confeſs, dear Brother, replied <hi>Leriana,</hi> that you have reaſon to make me this reproach, and according to all outward appearance, I am very much in the wrong. But I think you will not long condemn my Conduct; and that there is nothing ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier than for me to juſtifie my ſelf.</q> After theſe words, which promiſed <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> the information he deſired; <hi>Leriana</hi> muſed for ſome moments, and afterwards began to ſpeak in this manner.</p>
            <pb n="87" facs="tcp:103174:43"/>
            <p>
               <q>You know, dear Brother, that I was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry happily martied: That <hi>Lycirnus</hi> had an entire Complaiſance for me, and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving carried me to <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> where the greateſt part of his Eſtate lay, he endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſweeten the regret I might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, for leaving <hi>Corinth.</hi> You remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, without doubt, that my good fortune laſted but a little while, and that I loſt <hi>Lycirnus</hi> in a little time after <hi>Cyleſira</hi>'s Birth. At that time I cared for nothing ſo much as my Daughters Education. And Prince <hi>Gilipus,</hi> having heard in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I applied my ſelf thereunto, had a great mind I ſhould beſtow part of my Cares on the Princeſs his Daughter. <hi>Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atis</hi> was much of an age with <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> and Prince <hi>Gilipus</hi> cauſed her to be brought up in a fine Houſe he had near <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> on the Bank of the River <hi>Alpheus.</hi> He drew me to that agreeable place, called <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beus,</hi> and promiſed me to make <hi>Cyleſira's</hi> Fortune, according to the pains and care I ſhould take with the Princeſs. He never came from <hi>Sparta,</hi> without making me rich preſents; and the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> whom he brought along with him, began very early to admire <hi>Agiatis</hi>'s Beauty, and were alſo uſed to ſhew ſome little Complaiſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to <hi>Cyleſira.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Democares,</hi> a Man of great
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103174:44"/>courage, and very conſiderable among the <hi>Spartans,</hi> was the moſt aſſiduous at <hi>Erabeus,</hi> and <hi>Gilipus</hi> reſolved to give him <hi>Cyleſira</hi> in marriage, at the ſame time as <hi>Agis</hi> ſhould eſpouſe the Princeſs.
<q>
                  <hi>We made a Voyage to Lacedemon</hi> to that purpoſe, but the Civil Wars did occaſion the delaying of <hi>Agiatis</hi>'s marriage; and <hi>Gilipus</hi> fearing, in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs's behalf, the threatnings of a certain Aſtrologer, deſired that ſhe ſhould remove to ſome diſtance from <hi>Sparta.</hi> He returned to <hi>Erabeus,</hi> and having called me, together with <hi>Agiatis,</hi> into his Cloſet, he told me, that he would entruſt me with that which he eſteemed deareſt in the World. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuffer, purſued he, my Daughter to ſtay in a Town where ſo great a Diviſion reigns. Go, and ſeek out, along with her, ſome place, where you may live at peace and quietneſs. Ah Sir, interrupted <hi>Agiatis,</hi> being very much ſurpriſed, what Peace or repoſe would you have me find, when I ſhall be out of your ſight? Shall I not be doubly diſquieted, if I leave you in thoſe dangers which I ſhall not ſhare with you? But Daughter, replied <hi>Gilipus,</hi> what neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is there, that you ſhould incur thoſe dangers? Glory requires that I expoſe my ſelf to them, and Decency permits you to avoid them. Obey me then, on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103174:44"/>as you have done in all others. And you, <hi>Leriana,</hi> I pray remember, that I put into your hands all the comfort of my Life. I have given all neceſſary orders concerning your departure. <hi>Democares</hi> ſhall command your Convoy, and you may be ſure he will not be wanting to pay a deference to your deſires. Let <hi>Corinth</hi> be the place of your retreat; for beſides that it is your Country, you will find there one of my Friends, the famous <hi>Aratus,</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the <hi>Achaians.</hi> His Troops are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp about <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Sycion,</hi> until ſuch time as they be obliged to march againſt the <hi>Aetolians;</hi> ſo that, according to all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, you will have <hi>Aratus</hi>'s ſupport, as long as our diſorders will continue.</q> He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards took ſuch meaſures, as might be neceſſary for the execution of his deſign, and, notwithſtanding his own and <hi>Agiatis</hi>'s grief, that Princeſs's departure was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be on the morrow. There hapned to <hi>Cyleſira</hi> a fit of ſickneſs, which retained her at <hi>Erabeus;</hi> and <hi>Agiatis</hi> was no ſooner on this ſide the River <hi>Alpheus,</hi> but ſhe bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed your Nieces Name, and told me, ſhe would paſs for my Daughter.
<q>I ſhall find ſo little difficulty in obeying you, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe,</hi> that you will do me a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in ſpeaking to me, and acting like a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103174:45"/>Mother, without any longer delay. With all my heart, Madam, <hi>I anſwered,</hi> ſince it is for your Intereſt. I will take upon me, before the World, the ſeeming Authority you give me, and I will not treat you with as much reſpect as I ought, but in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of thoſe Perſons to whom you ſhall have imparted the ſecret.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>We obſerved this Order moſt exactly; and <hi>Democares,</hi> for his part, acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf admirably of his employment; he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtirred from the Princeſs, and had not much leſs Complaiſance for me. You ſaw with what reluctancy he parted from us, and how he proteſted, that he would not have returned, if the Intereſts of <hi>Gili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> had not called him to <hi>Sparta.</hi> In the mean time, you admired your pretended Niece, all the World was touch'd with her Beauty, and deſired leave to come and viſit us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agiatis</hi> could not live in ſuch a Crowd, and having intreated me to deliver her out of it, you ſhould have brought us to <hi>Egi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> at that very time, if the General of the <hi>Achaians</hi> had not come to <hi>Corinth.</hi> I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him a Letter from <hi>Gilipus;</hi> and you know, he ſo much concerned himſelf in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, that had any relation to <hi>Agia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> that it was ſoon believed, his Heart was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103174:45"/>not inſenſible of that Princeſs's Beauty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aratus</hi> knew they had that Opinion of him, yet did not give over to continue his cares of her. He teſtified to <hi>Onecryſa</hi> and <hi>Ariamite,</hi> that he would be very glad they ſhould make a particular bond of Friendſhip with <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> and in a few days after theſe two Princeſſes did confeſs, that it was with much pleaſure they had followed <hi>Aratus</hi>'s Advice. You have ſeen, as well as I, every thing that has afterwards hapned; and to give you an account of what concerns your Niece, I will tell you, that <hi>Democares</hi> has an affection for her, and that <hi>Gilipus</hi> thinks ſit ſhe ſhould entertain him, as a Man to to whom he had deſign'd to give her in Marriage. He was alſo willing ſhe ſhould anſwers his Letters; but <hi>Democares</hi> never received any anſwer to them with too much haſte. <hi>Cyleſira</hi> never fails to ſend them me, and I make ſuch returns as I think fit.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus, dear Brother, you have a ſhort Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which juſtifies my Conduct. I would not have failed to give you this Information, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Princeſs would have been going away; and if you think you have reaſon to complain, becauſe I have kept it ſecret to this day; I muſt tell you, that I did not do it, becauſe I thought you could have wanted Fidelity or Diſcretion. It was rather becauſe I was not
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103174:46"/>Miſtreſs of a ſecret that concerned</hi> Gilipus <hi>and</hi> Agiatis; <hi>and becauſe I had rather ſee you car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry your ſelf without any conſtraint before the Princeſs, as if ſhe really had been your Niece, than diſcover her to you, without any neceſſity for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leoſthenes,</hi> ſurprized at what he had heard, cried out, as ſoon as <hi>Leriana</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over ſpeaking, <hi>Is it poſſible, O Siſter, is it poſſible, that it is the Princeſs</hi> Agiatis, <hi>who is at my Houſe? You muſt obtain my pardon for the Faults you have made me commit; and far from giving you any reproach for your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, I ſhall always applaud a ſilence, which few other Women would have kept.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He afterwards deſired to make his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Princeſs; <hi>Leriana</hi> preſented him to her, and he was received after the moſt obliging manner he could have deſired. Nevertheleſs, their Converſation did not laſt long. <hi>Leriana</hi> writ to <hi>Gilipus,</hi> to give him an account of what had paſſed; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, diſcourſing with the Princeſs about it, ſhe ſaid, <hi>What a misfortune, Madam, would it have been, if</hi> Teleander <hi>had carried you away to</hi> Erymanthus? <hi>What would have been the affliction of Prince</hi> Gilipus, <hi>and King</hi> Agis? <hi>I muſt confeſs, replied</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>it is a moſt grievous matter for a Father, to ſee his only Daughter ſtole from him; but I did not
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103174:46"/>expect you would place</hi> Agis <hi>in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of vexation, as</hi> Gilipus. <hi>How, Madam, replied</hi> Leriana, <hi>do you believe that</hi> Agis <hi>would not be very ſenſible of your loſs? He who knows you ſo well, and is deſigned to be your Husband? 'Tis true, replied</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>there is a reſolution to match us to each other; but ſince it is only to faſten, by that Alliance, the knot that ties our Party, I think the Heart has no great intereſt in the Treaty, and that neither of us would find any great difficulty to comfort our ſelves, ſhould it chance to break. In truth,</hi> Leriana, <hi>we have not the one for the other, more than the Friendſhip of Kindred, and I very much doubt, whether one can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from that ſort of Affection to tenderneſs. I have, nevertheleſs, obſerved, replied</hi> Leria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, <hi>that</hi> Agis<hi>'s admiration of you, was always accompanied with eagerneſs and fervency. 'Tis true, the eſteem you have for that Prince, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds more from a ſenſe of Equity than Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I have wiſht an hundred times, that, for the Peace of both Families, and of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> Agiatis <hi>were married to</hi> Cleomenes. <hi>That young Prince is, as I have heard, endued with a thouſand good qualities. He is of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Deportment and great Courage. I agree, ſaid</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>that all the World reports very well of</hi> Cleomenes; <hi>but,</hi> Leriana, <hi>do you judge they have bred up</hi> Leonidas <hi>'s Son, and</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:103174:47"/>Gilipus<hi>'s Daughter, to be each others? By what I perceive, Madam, ſaid</hi> Leriana, <hi>look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attentively upon her, you have a great ſtock of indifference in your Heart. I have at leaſt averſion enough for Marriage,</hi> replied the Princeſs. <hi>Ah, Madam, purſued</hi> Leriana, <hi>I know from whence that averſion proceeds; 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you find your ſelf diſpoſed to love a Man, whom you cannot Marry. I perceive well enough, replied</hi> Agiatis, and bluſht, <hi>that you mean</hi> Themiſtides; <hi>but ſhould my gratitude render me more ſenſible for him, than for a Kinſman, or a Prince whom I never ſaw, would you think it very ſtrange? But,</hi> Leriana, <hi>know me perfectly, and re-aſſure your ſelf, I have a Father, whoſe Will and Pleaſure ſhall always regulate mine; and ſhould</hi> Agiatis <hi>be in a capacity to diſpoſe of her ſelf, ſhe would rather die, than fail in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing her Quality or Honour required from her. After this, take what meaſures you pleaſe, and be not apprehenſive I ſhall oppoſe them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as ſhe had made that Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Leriana</hi> ſet her mind at reſt. She ſent to <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> to enquire after his Health; and as ſoon as ſhe was informed he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Viſits, without being incommoded, ſhe went to ſee him with <hi>Cyleſira</hi> and <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> in her company.
<q>You ſee, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> that I am as good as my word; and that, in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103174:47"/>coming to viſit you, I grant you more than you have deſired from me. You do too much, Madam, anſwered <hi>Cleomenes;</hi> and you judge aright, that I would have by no means have deſired, what I ought not to obtain.</q> He had hardly ended theſe words, when <hi>Leriana</hi> was advertiſed, that <hi>Aratus</hi> and <hi>Ariamite</hi> were juſt arrived; that the Princeſs was gone to <hi>Onecryſa</hi>'s, and that the General of the <hi>Achaians</hi> was come into <hi>Xenares</hi>'s Houſe. <hi>Leriana, Cyleſira,</hi> and <hi>Xenares</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately aroſe, and having left <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> with <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> they went to receive <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus,</hi> whom they met at the Chamber-door. He ſaid to <hi>Leriana,</hi>
               <q>Madam, muſt your Friends have no other information of what befalls you, than what they gather from common report? Sir, <hi>anſwered ſhe,</hi> you know apparently the reaſon which hath not permitted me to give you an account of this adventure. Yes, Madam, I know it, replied <hi>Aratus,</hi> and that not without a great deal of ſorrow; but will you give me leave, <hi>added he, advancing towards</hi> Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes<hi>'s bed,</hi> to thank the generous <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides,</hi> who has ſo fortunately prevented the miſchiefs that were to be feared from that attempt. Sir, replied the Prince; as there is never any judgment to be made of our Actions, but according to our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103174:48"/>ſo you may eaſily perceive, that you are no ways obliged to me. I was not ſtudious of ſerving <hi>Aratus,</hi> but of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Cyleſira.</hi> Well then, replied the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> ſince you are unwilling that I expreſs my gratitude unto you, I have nothing to do, but to chide <hi>Leriana,</hi> for coming to <hi>Egina.</hi> Sir, anſwered ſhe, My Brother's Houſe, and <hi>Cyleſira's</hi> humour, made me fix upon that choice. You might have, replied <hi>Aratus,</hi> preferred <hi>Scycion</hi> before this Deſart; I ſhould have rendered your dwelling there agreeable. But, Sir, replied <hi>Xenares,</hi> why ſhould ſo fair a Lady leave <hi>Corinth,</hi> at a time when people flock't thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from all parts of <hi>Greece?</hi> She would have been the joy of an infinite number of Gentlemen, and thoſe Gentlemen would have contributed to her divertiſement. Since I think you ſpeak of me, anſwered <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> though what you ſay ſuits not with me, I muſt tell you, that I find much leſs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure than trouble and confuſion, in great and publick Feaſts; and that I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly avoid them, if I were Miſtreſs of my own Will. Is it poſſible, replied <hi>Aratus,</hi> that you are of that humour? You, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, who are not Created, but to be the admiration of all the Earth. But, Sir, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> is it not alſo neceſſary, to have
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103174:48"/>an entire complaiſance for her, as well as an admiration, which is due to her, from all the World.</q> 
               <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> out of a little emotion of jealouſie, could not forbear being contradictory, and <hi>Xenares</hi> taking notice of it, ſaid to him,
<q>I doubt you do not mind who it is you conteſt with? 'Tis, replied <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> with the famous General-of the <hi>Achaians;</hi> but fince the queſtion is not about the rangeing of an Army in Battle; I hope I may, without offence, deliver my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, altho' it be different from his. On the contrary, purſued <hi>Aratus;</hi> 'tis that liberty of contradicting, that creates all the pleaſure of Converſation; without it, our diſcourſe could neither laſt, nor have any Wit or Spirit in it. Moreover, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <hi>Leoſthenes,</hi> after the Glory <hi>Themiſtides</hi> has gained, has he not reaſon to rejoyce, that <hi>Cyleſira</hi> came to <hi>Egina?</hi> As he is Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, <hi>replied the Princeſs,</hi> I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he does not repent the incurring a great danger, for the doing a brave Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but I am very ſorry, I was the cauſe—Ha Madam, <hi>interrupted Cleomenes,</hi> had I loſt even my life upon this occaſion. I had been ſufficiently rewarded, with the good Fortune I have had of being ſerviceable unto you.</q> 
               <hi>Aratus,</hi> obſerving that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> ſpoke with ſome trouble, ſaid to <hi>Xenares,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103174:49"/>Do you believe that</hi> Themiſtides<hi>'s health will allow us to ſtay any longer with him? Methinks, that in the Condition wherein we ſee him, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſo neceſſary for him as repoſe. How, Sir, replied</hi> Cleomenes, <hi>can you believe—I believe,</hi> interrupted <hi>Aratus, that a longer viſit would be hurtful to you, and that we ought to hearken to you no longer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that moment, a Servant of <hi>Onecryſa</hi>'s deſired to ſpeak with him, and ſaid to him, <hi>Sir, the Princeſs is fallen into a deadly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, being informed you are no leſs enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt her, than againſt the Prince. They both deſire to juſtifie themſelves, and humbly intreat you would do them the honour, to viſit them before you return to</hi> Corinth. <hi>Tell your Miſtreſs, replied</hi> Aratus, <hi>that ſhe ought not to intreat a viſit, with which ſhe would be leſs ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied than ſhe believes. The Mother is more criminal than the Son; and I fear, leſt the blind Indulgence and Complaiſance ſhe has for him, will, in the end, create her many troubles.</hi> He ſent away the Servant, and departs with <hi>Cyleſira</hi> and <hi>Leriana.</hi> He was no ſooner ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> his Houſe, but he ſpoke to <hi>Cyleſira</hi> in particular. <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>we will carry you back with us to</hi> Corinth? The Princeſs ſtudied a while, inſtead of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, and finding a ſecret reluctancy in her ſelf to depart from <hi>Egina,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Sir, ſince</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:103174:49"/>Leoſthenes <hi>has not finiſhed his buſineſs that brought him hither, and ſince there is ſtill at</hi> Corinth <hi>an infinite number of ſtrangers, by whom I would not willingly be ſeen; I had beſt, in my Opinion, ſtay ſeven or eight days yet longer in this Iſle. Aratus</hi> conſented to it, and leaving behind ſome Officers for the Princeſs's ſecurity, returned back to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was hardly departed, when a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man from <hi>Ariamite</hi> came to <hi>Leoſthenes</hi>'s, and told <hi>Leriana</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> that his Miſtreſs was in deſpair for what had happened. <hi>She intreats you,</hi> added he, <hi>that you would not let the reſentment you may have for the Brother, reach the Siſter. We are not ſo unjuſt, replied</hi> Leriana, <hi>as to hate the Princeſs</hi> Ariamite, <hi>for a Crime, whereof ſhe is no Abettor. Will you then be pleaſed, Madam,</hi> replied the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>that ſhe ſhould come and ſee how much the Prince</hi> Teleander <hi>had offended her. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it, replied</hi> Leriana, <hi>and I would even prevent her, if I could. But though Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity requires us to pardon</hi> Teleander; <hi>yet De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency will not allow us to go to a Prince's Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, who has ſo lately affronted us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a few moments after <hi>Ariamite</hi> entred, and teſtified the diſpleaſure ſhe conceived for what had paſſed. <hi>I aſſure you,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that</hi> Teleander <hi>is in a condition more proper to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103174:50"/>your Compaſſion, than your Anger. He has four wounds dangerous enough. He was carried to his Lodgings on a Hurdle made with boughs of Trees, and covered with his Cloaths and Leaves. Judge alſo in what affliction a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought to be, who tenderly loves her Son. Nevertheleſs ſhe does not fail to think, that you have reaſon to complain of her; and I am ordered to proteſt unto you, in her behalf, that ſhe is extreamly ſorry for it. She intreats you to conſider that</hi> Teleander <hi>has offended you, only out of an exceſs of Love, and that he had no other deſign upon</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>than to make her Princeſs of</hi> Erymanthus. <hi>But you know, Madam, replied</hi> Leriana, <hi>that violence is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be made uſe of in ſuch deſigns; Men commonly take a contrary Method. However, we are ſorry</hi> Teleander <hi>is ſo ill as you tell us. I wiſh he may gather ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from this Adventure; that he may moderate the impetuoſity of his Humour; and that the Princeſs</hi> Onecryſa <hi>may, for her part, be no longer Complaiſant to favour his unjuſt enterprizes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While they were entertaining each other after this melancholly manner, <hi>Themiſtides</hi> talked very differently to <hi>Philiſtion.</hi> This <hi>Corinthian,</hi> not being much incommoded with his Wounds, had paſſed from his own Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Apartment. The Prince
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103174:50"/>had no ſooner perceived him, but ſtretching out his Arms towards him, called out with a paſſionate voice,
<q>My Dear, <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> I have ſeen <hi>Cyleſira;</hi> I have ſeen her in my Chamber, and I conceive a Joy for it, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than I can expreſs. Can you go to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to her, to acquaint her of it? Yes, Sir, <hi>anſwered he,</hi> I will go. But, <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> can you expreſs all that I am ſenſible of? Have you never been in love? Do you love me enough to paint to the Life, in <hi>Cyleſira</hi>'s imagination, what I would be glad ſhould be repreſented to her? Wo' not you pardon me, if I add a Billet to the Commiſſion I give you? Sir, replied <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> in the Condition wherein you are, you can hardly write, without doing your ſelf harm. On the contrary, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Prince,</hi> my Heart will receive thereby ſo much comfort, that it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to my Health. Give me ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Pen, and Ink, let me make uſe of an opportunity that now preſents it ſelf, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn my thanks; let me, I pray, employ this minute of Liberty, which <hi>Xenares</hi>'s abſence allows me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philiſtion</hi> conſented to it, and, on the morrow, he carried <hi>Themiſtides</hi>'s Letter to <hi>Leoſthenes</hi>'s Houſe. He was a great while there, before he could deliver it; but <hi>Leria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:103174:51"/>being at length gone into her Cloſet, he ſaid to <hi>Cyleſira,</hi>
               <q>Madam, I am come to render you thanks, in behalf of <hi>Themiſtides.</hi> He could not, before all the People, who were in his Chamber, thank you in ſuch a manner as he deſired. Do you, <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> think, anſwered <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> that it is <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides</hi>'s part to give me thanks? No Man knows, better than your ſelf, the difference there is between what we have done for each other. However, replied <hi>Philiſtion, Themiſtides</hi> believes he is in your debt, and that the Service he has rendred you, does not deſerve the recompence it hath received. But, Madam, <hi>added he, preſenting to her the Letters he was charged with, Themiſtides</hi> explains himſelf, without doubt, in this Billet, better than I can do. How! a Letter, replied <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> with a ſurprize, and bluſhing. Ah, <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me, I intreat you, to receive it. You may do what you pleaſe with it, replied <hi>Philiſtion;</hi> but if you refuſe this Letter, you will reduce <hi>Themiſtides</hi> to deſpair. You will ſoon ſee, that his Wounds will not be the moſt dangerous of his Evils. I ſhould be very ſorry for it, replied <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> but you give me no ſmall diſpleaſure, in conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to a Complaiſance which I ought not to have.</q>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103174:52"/>nor ungrateful, I perceive what his Merit is, and I reſent, as I ought to do, the effects of his Generoſity. Methinks, Madam, replied</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtion, <hi>that two words under your hand would tell it better than I.

<q>But, Sir, replied the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> is your Health ſo well recovered, as to give you leave? You know, replied <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> my Wounds trouble me but a little, and I aſſure you, they are not to be feared ſo much as my Melancholly. I ſhall dye with Grief,

            <head type="sub">The Second Part.</head>
            <p>THE Prince of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> paſſed the Night with an Impatience, that hindred him to Sleep, and he fail'd not to get up, as ſoon as he ſaw the day appear. He took a Javeline in his hand to lean upon, when he ſhould find it neceſſary, and he went to walk all alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling to cauſe <hi>Philiſtion</hi> to be awaked ſo early. He ſearcht for the moſt private places in <hi>Thetis</hi>'s Wood; that he might me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate at more repoſe, on the engagement,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103174:54"/>whereunto he had been, as it were, drawn by his Fate; and of which he had the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, not to dare to hope for a favourable ſucceſs.
<q>Alas! <hi>ſaid he to himſelf,</hi> can I hope to move <hi>Cyleſira</hi>'s Heart, if after what has now paſſed, ſhe will not daign ſo much as to anſwer her Defenders Letter? Was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch a ſeverity known? What, to reſolve obſtinately not to write.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He could not go on, by reaſon of a noiſe he heard; he ſtood up and caſt his Eyes on every ſide. He perceived a Wolf tearing a bag of Fleſh, and eating what he took out of it. <hi>Themiſtides</hi> lift up his Javeline, and being no leſs expert at darting, than at his other Exerciſes, he fail'd not to hit the Wolf in the Body. That Animal went twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or thirty paces from his Prey to dye, and <hi>Themiſtides</hi> coming nearer the Bag, ſaw ſome Letters fallen out of it, that were unſealed by ſome violent accident. He took them up, and he had hardly looked on the Superſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when he was ſurprized in a moſt ſtrange manner. He knew them to be Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which <hi>Leriana</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> directed to a certain <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> called <hi>Democares.</hi> He was extreamly deſirous to ſee what two Perſons, ſo ſevere, could write to that Man, and to overcome a ſcruple that oppoſed his Curioſity, he imagined with himſelf, that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103174:54"/>Fortune did not offer him theſe Billets open, to any other end, than that he might read them without reluctancy. He purſued a ſentiment more conformable to his Paſſion, than to his Humour, and beginning with the Letter that went neareſt his Heart, he found it was in theſe terms.</p>

               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> is confirmed in the knowledge of his unhappineſs; he ſighs, and lifts up his Eyes to Heaven.
<q>O ye Gods, <hi>ſays he,</hi> after this, that I have now ſeen, what is not to be believed of Women's diſſimulation?</q> He afterwards calls to mind, that he had heard talk of <hi>Democares,</hi> as of a <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> in <hi>Agis</hi>'s Party, and wonders that the ſame <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> who has ſo much haugtineſs in her Countenance, ſhould have ſo little in her Heart, as to prefer a ſimple Citizen of <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon,</hi> before the Prince of <hi>Erymanthus.</hi> In that moment, he excites himſelf to ſcorn her; he conſiders her as a Perſon, who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteems it the higheſt pitch of her happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to follow the Fortunes of a Man, who will one day be his Subject. But that fierce diſdain laſts but a little while, and the Idea of the Charming <hi>Cyleſira</hi> ſoon recovers its former power. It may be ſaid, he feels even an addition of Love, and that there are ſome Inſtants wherein he mingles Joy with his Diſquiets. He imagines with himſelf, that ſince <hi>Cyleſira</hi> is ſenſible in reſpect of <hi>Democares,</hi> ſhe may hereafter become the ſame for <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> when ſhe will know his true conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Nevertheſs, this Opinion, wherewith he flatters himſelf, is only grounded upon Conjectures, and cannot hold out againſt an unhappineſs, which he finds but too certain.</p>

            <p>He returns home, and goes to find out
<q>
                  <hi>Xenares.</hi> I would fain know, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> who is that <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> called <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocares,</hi> of whom I have heard ſo much diſcourſe? I can eaſily ſatisfie you, replied <hi>Xenares; Democares</hi> is of a conſiderable Family in <hi>Sparta,</hi> and it may be ſaid he has made himſelf terrible, during our Civil-Wars. He is of a very tall Stature, and of a Strength and Courage much more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary. He has thrown himſelf into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis</hi>'s Faction, and 'tis ſaid, he is altogether at <hi>Gilipus</hi>'s Devotion. <hi>Amphares</hi> and <hi>Arce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilaus,</hi> whoſe Names, you know, are linkt with him in a very ſtraight bond of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip—But have you not heard it ſaid, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted <hi>Cleòmenes,</hi> that <hi>Democares</hi> is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous of ſome Charming Perſon, whom he is upon the point of Marrying?</q> 
               <hi>Xendres</hi> anſwered, that he never heard any diſcourſe of it. However, the Prince was ſtill ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a ſorrow, which was too well grounded to quit it eaſily.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he had dined, he went to <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſthenes</hi>'s Houſe. <hi>Leriana</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to him, that they were very glad to ſee him, and obſerving that there was ſome marks of ſadneſs in his face, <q>How! <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides,</hi> ſaid <hi>Leriana</hi> to him, are you allowed to be melancholly, while you are recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

You judge aright, replied <hi>Leriana,</hi> we ought not to make our Reſidence in this Iſle: And it may poſſibly be reproached unto us as a fault, that we have ſtaid here one ſingle moment, after what has hapned to us. Nevertheleſs, methinks, <hi>continued Cyleſira,</hi> that we may now do it without danger. We need no longer fear <hi>Teleander,</hi> ſince we have <hi>Themiſtides</hi> for our Defender. You are going to leave that <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> replied <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> to return into a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where there are Men who are better known unto you, and more agreeable. I aſſure you, replied <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> that I do not underſtand you; and you will pleaſure me, added <hi>Leriana,</hi> to explain your ſelf a little better. I will then tell you, Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> you will ſoon go into a Town, from whence, in all appearance, the Civil Wars have cauſed you to remove, and where you are to compleat the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Lover, to whom the Charming <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſira</hi> is appointed. Ah, <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> replied <hi>Leriana,</hi> you know too much, and I ſhould conceive a mortal diſpleaſure for it, if I were ignorant of your diſcretion.</q> She could ſay no more, <hi>Ariamite</hi> entred, and <hi>Cleomenes,</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:103174:57"/>having no longer the freedom of diſcourſe, departed in a few moments after, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair in his Heart. He went again into the Wood, to abandon himſelf to his Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and walked until his wearineſs conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to ſit down. Then he would read over again <hi>Leriana</hi>'s and <hi>Cyleſira</hi>'s Letters, on purpoſe to augment the vexation he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived already; and when his Mind was no leſs tired than his Body, he fell inſenſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſlumber, holding in his hand the Letter that had inſtructed him in his misfortune. In the mean time <hi>Ariamite</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> went to take the freſh Air into the Wood, and Chance conducted them to the place where <hi>Themiſtides</hi> lay aſleep. They ſtop, look upon the Prince, and obſerving that he had let the Letters fall, <hi>Ariamite</hi> takes them up, and caſts her Eyes upon them. As ſoon as ſhe ſaw <hi>Cyleſira</hi>'s Letter, ſhe could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to cry out, ſo much was ſhe ſurprized at it. <hi>Themiſtides</hi> awakes, riſes up, and they look all three upon each other, without ſaying one word. At length <hi>Cleomenes</hi> cleared the doubts of the two Princeſſes, and related to them his adventure in the morning. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amite</hi> was over-joyed at it, and beholding <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> ſaid unto her with a ſmile, <hi>By what I ſee, thoſe People that are haughty, know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how to love, and are more diſſembling than
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103174:57"/>I imagined. But to be more ſerious with you, I confeſs unto you, that I have reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the little Confidence you have in me. And if you will not diſcover to me what your engagment is, I will never pardon you, for keeping it ſecret from me. You would be, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, very much ſurprized,</hi> replied <hi>Cyleſira, if I ſhould tell you there is a greater myſtery in theſe Letters, than you imagine, and in my Heart a leſs tenderneſs for</hi> Democares. Then ſhe caſt her Eyes upon <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> in a way that made it ſufficiently known, that ſhe ſaid theſe laſt words, but for his ſake on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>In that moment, a Man, in whoſe Face there appeared trouble enough, advances to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> and ſays unto her, <hi>Madam, there has an accident happened to me, that puts me in a ſtrange confuſion.</hi> Leriana <hi>ſent me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a diſtant Country, with ſtrict orders to make extraordinary haſte. She had given me two Letters, and one of my own Friends was to bring me a third. I waited for him in this Wood, not daring to ſhew my ſelf in</hi> Palenis, <hi>for fear</hi> Leriana <hi>ſhould know that I was not yet depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In the mean time I fell aſleep, and having put in the ſame Bag with</hi> Leriana<hi>'s Letters, ſomething to eat, during my paſſage in the Ship, a Wolf, that paſſed very near me, ſcented out my little Proviſions, and carried them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103174:58"/>Bag and all, as a young Shepherdeſs, who ſaw it, juſt now informed me. So that, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I am not in a condition, either to purſue my Voyage, or to return to</hi> Leoſthenes<hi>'s. You may do either the one or the other, replied</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſira, <hi>your Letters are not loſt, and I think that</hi> Themiſtides <hi>will not refuſe to reſtore them. You need only relate your adventure to</hi> Leriana, <hi>ſhe will pardon you, ſeal again her Letters, and diſpatch you away. Well then, Madam, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Cleomenes <hi>with a Sigh, I will reſtore what Fortune has made to fall into my Hands. I plainly perceive that you are unwilling I ſhould keep the Letters, that are to give</hi> Democares <hi>ſo much Joy, and which others were not able to read without Sorrow. The Perſons whom you mean, replied</hi> Ariamite in loſing all hopes, <hi>ought to have baniſhed another Paſſion from their Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Counſel that Princeſs gave by the By to <hi>Cleomenes;</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> who had already a ſtrong inclination for the Prince, did not comprehend this Diſcourſe, without a vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſhe could not diſſemble.
<q>You ſhall attribute to what Sentiments you pleaſe, <hi>ſhe replied,</hi> the tranſports of <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and the generoſity of <hi>Themiſtides;</hi> but for <hi>Democares,</hi> I will once again tell you, that I ſhall never be his, and that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which ſeem to perſwade the contrary,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103174:58"/>are leſs Intelligible than you believe them to be. I will believe what you have a mind to, replied <hi>Ariamite</hi> coldly, when you will have made what you ſay, agree with what you write. But, in the mean time, you had better do a thing that will be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier for you. 'Tis to make that Man's Peace, who is ſtill in great Affliction.</q> As ſoon as ſhe had ended theſe words, they all three took the way towards <hi>Palenis,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, without going on with any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; ſo much were they buſied in their thoughts. <hi>Ariamite</hi> was very glad, that <hi>Themiſtides</hi> had ſeen how <hi>Cyleſira</hi> was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to <hi>Democares,</hi> and yet ſhe felt a ſecret vexation, to find that <hi>Themiſtides</hi> did not give over appearing as Amorous of her, as before. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> was, for his part, agitated with a mixture of Love and Sorrow, which would not allow him to expreſs his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo much by his Mouth, as by his Eyes; and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> did not conſider, without an extraordinary diſpleaſure, that the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſecret, which ſhe was obliged to keep, did not give her leave to diſabuſe <hi>Themiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi> They arrived at <hi>Palenis,</hi> and ſaid ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few words at parting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyleſira</hi>'s thoughts ran on nothing more than on the Opinion they might have of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended engagement with <hi>Democares.</hi> She
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103174:59"/>was ſo vext at it, that ſhe immediately ſeeks out an opportunity to diſabuſe that <hi>Themiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> for whom ſhe is already ſenſible of a tenderneſs, which ſhe takes for an inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proceeding from Gratitude. She is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to diſcover to him, that ſhe is <hi>Agiatis;</hi> but when ſhe is upon the point of making that Declaration, as ſhe does not believe that <hi>Themiſtides</hi> is a Prince, ſhe cannot reſolve to tell him, that ſhe is a Princeſs, and to let him know that their Conditions are une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual.</p>
            <p>In the Evening <hi>Xenares</hi> and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> received ſome Letters from <hi>Leonidas.</hi> That which the King writ to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> was in theſe terms.</p>

            <p>The Prince could not read it over without ſighing. He ſaw that he muſt go to <hi>Sparta,</hi> when a violent Paſſion would ſtay him in <hi>Egina. Xenares</hi> perceiving his diſquiet, gueſſes at the cauſe of it, and asks <hi>Cleomenes</hi> how ſoon he will depart. <hi>As ſoon as my Health will permit me to undertake a Voyage,</hi> anſwered he. But the Prince being melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, <hi>Xenares</hi> withdraws, inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the Converſation.</p>
            <p>On the morrow in the morning, <hi>Leriana</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> received the anſwers they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from <hi>Gilipus.</hi> That Prince expreſſes to them, that he was glad to ſee that the misfortune, with which <hi>Agiatis</hi> had been threatned, had not found thoſe Conſequences which he had apprehended. He intreats <hi>Leriana</hi> to thank <hi>Aratus,</hi> to deliver him a Letter he had writ to him, and to depart in a few days after, in order to return to <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beus.</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:103174:60"/>So that <hi>Cyleſira</hi> repaſſes immediately to <hi>Corinth,</hi> together with <hi>Leriana</hi> and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes,</hi> and thoſe Officers that <hi>Aratus</hi> had left to guard her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> is informed preſently of their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and tells <hi>Xenares</hi> that he would fain go to <hi>Corinth,</hi> to accuſtom himſelf to thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues, which a greater Journey require. <hi>Xenares</hi> ſees the reaſon of this change, but ſeeing alſo that the Prince is going to remove far enough off from <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> and that, in all probability, for the remaining part of his days, he oppoſes not his intentions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts along with him, in order to repaſs to <hi>Corinth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are no ſooner arrived there, but <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> and <hi>Philiſtion</hi> go to <hi>Leoſthenes</hi>'s Houſe, and are informed that he is gone to <hi>Aratus</hi>'s along with <hi>Cyleſira</hi> and <hi>Leriana. Leriana</hi> teſtifies to the General of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> the acknowledgments of <hi>Gilipus,</hi> and delivers him a Letter from that Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aratus</hi> offers the Princeſs every thing that could render her Journey more Secure and Commodious, and in a moment after, he is interrupted by one of his Officers, who came to give him notice, that <hi>Teleander</hi> was juſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived. <hi>But, Sir,</hi> purſues he, <hi>this is not all. The Princeſs</hi> Onecryſa <hi>deſires to ſee you, and ſays abſolutely, that you muſt pardon her, for
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103174:60"/>the Complaiſance ſhe had for the Prince of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rymanthus. Agiatis, <hi>for her part, ſays, that ſhe ſhould have a ſenſible diſpleaſure, if</hi> Aratus <hi>refuſed to receive</hi> Onecryſa<hi>'s viſit; and as ſoon as ſhe is gone out of the room, the General of the</hi> Achaians <hi>conſents, that they ſhould call his Siſter in. That Princeſs obſerves, that there is ſomething ſevere in</hi> Aratus<hi>'s Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. I plainly perceive, Sir,</hi> ſays ſhe to him, <hi>that you are ſtill angry with me. Have I not reaſon to be ſo, replies</hi> Aratus? <hi>Would you have me be pleaſed with your being an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettor of a Rape, with your acting jointly with a paſſionate young Fool, to offend a Perſon I reſpect? You muſt indeed,</hi> replied <hi>Onecryſa, have a very great conſideration for</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>ſince you prefer her before all your Kindred. You ought not, methinks, be in anger with</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leander <hi>for any thing, but for deſiring to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry an unknown Woman, whoſe Alliance would have done you but little Honour. You ſhall ſoon know, replies</hi> Aratus, <hi>that there is no blood more Illuſtrious, than is that of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Lady's, and you ſhall ſee, that</hi> Cyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſira <hi>would be matched as much below her ſelf, in marrying</hi> Teleander, <hi>as</hi> Teleander <hi>believed he ſhould have raiſed her, by making her Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of</hi> Erymanthus. <hi>In effect, Madam, I ſhall in a few days be permitted to diſcover to you the whole Secret. In the mean time, I declare
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103174:61"/>unto you, that</hi> Cyleſira <hi>is a Princeſs, and that ſhe is ſhortly to be a Queen. Judge then, if</hi> Teleander<hi>'s enterpriſe could have happy Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and if the execution of it would be left unpuniſhed. Be not aſtoniſhed at this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, which I make you by halves. Since</hi> Cyleſira <hi>is upon the point of departing, I can without doing her any Prejudice, give you an advice, that may be ſerviceable to a Son's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, who is dear unto you. You ſee in what manner he is come from</hi> Egina, <hi>in ſpight of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodiouſneſs of his Wounds. Hinder him from following a Perſon, who is recalled into her own Country, for nothing leſs, than to aſcend a Throne, and you will ſpare him the vexation, which the ill ſucceſs of his Paſſion will certainly give him. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necryſa</hi> thanks <hi>Aratus,</hi> promiſes to follow his Counſel, and returns home with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. She finds <hi>Teleander</hi> dreſſed, and not doubting but that it was in order to go out, and to endeavour to ſee <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> ſhe ſpoke to him with greater vehemence than uſual.
<q>Do you conſider well what you are going to do? <hi>ſaies ſhe.</hi> Would you, without any reaſon, expoſe your ſelf to death? Do you pretend to go and ſee <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> whom you have offended, and ſhould you even chance to meet her in ſome Temple, or a walking, would you accoſt her to be ill uſed? In effect what deſign can you have? Not to ſtay any
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103174:61"/>longer in my Chamber, <hi>replies he,</hi> but to go and take the Air, and leave the reſt to the Conduct of Fortune. Son, <hi>replies ſhe,</hi> I penetrate but too far into your Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: 'Tis time you diſabuſe your ſelf. Should that which you have done in the Iſle of <hi>Egina,</hi> not deprive you of all hopes, I now underſtand, that <hi>Cyleſira</hi> is engaged, and that there is appointed for her an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, much more conſiderable than that which you would give her.</q> 
               <hi>Teleander</hi> ſurpriſed with this Diſcourſe, ſtands like one ſtruck with Thunder: Afterwards he ſo earneſtly preſſes <hi>Onecryſa</hi> not to conceal any thing from him, of what ſhe knows, that the Princeſs relates to him the Converſation, ſhe had juſt then held with <hi>Aratus,</hi> never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, upon condition, he ſhould never ſpeak of it to any Body.</p>
            <p>In the time that <hi>Teleander</hi> revolved in his memory, all that ever he had heard reported of the faireſt Princeſſes of the Age, to try if he could gueſs of what Country <hi>Cyleſira</hi> might be, Chance brings in a rich <hi>Athenian</hi> Merchant, who deſires to ſpeak with <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryſa.</hi>
               <q>Madam, <hi>ſays that Stranger to her,</hi> ſince you were not in Town, during the Games, which brought me hither, I would not go away without ſhewing you ſome Rarities, which poſſibly you may not find
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103174:62"/>elſe-where. I have ſome Jewels of great price; and I have alſo ſome Pictures in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that are of a much greater value than my Jewels. I will let you ſee ſeveral of the moſt Illuſtrious Perſons of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> If you have, interrupts <hi>Teleander,</hi> the Pictures of the moſt Charming Princeſſes of theſe our Countries, you need not doubt but that I ſhall look over them with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. I wiſh, replies the <hi>Athenian,</hi> I could ſatisfie your Curioſity. But, Sir, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Painter, with whom I deal, never cares to draw a fine Woman. He looks on that Undertaking as a dangerous Rock. Men of his Calling, are indeed conſtrained to flatter, if they would pleaſe thoſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for whom they work, and if they do flatter, you may be ſure they do not make a Picture very like. You may then, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies <hi>Teleander,</hi> carry your Great Men, and Old Women whither you pleaſe. My Daughter may fit her ſelf with ſome Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, ſays <hi>Onecryſa</hi> to the Merchant, and you will pleaſure me to ſee her.</q> The Stranger paſſes to <hi>Ariamite</hi>'s Appartment; he expoſes to Sale what he has moſt precious; and the Princeſs, after having bought ſome Bracelets of Ruby, deſires to ſee <hi>Aratus</hi>'s Picture, that ſhe might gueſs thereby, what reſemblance the others might have. The <hi>Athenian</hi> ſhews
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103174:62"/>her the General of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> and <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite</hi> is ſo ſatisfied with it, that ſhe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately deſires to ſee the reſt of the pieces. The Merchant is not of an opinion to chuſe out the Portraictures of Old Captains, or Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, for a young Princeſs; but he ſearches for thoſe of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> King of <hi>Egypt, Agis, Cleomenes,</hi> and of the young <hi>Perrhus</hi> King of the <hi>Epirots. Ariamite</hi> had no ſooner caſt her Eyes on <hi>Cleomenes's</hi> Face, but ſhe is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed and bluſhes; afterwards ſhewing the Picture, which attracts her looks, <hi>Is not that,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>the Pourtraict of a young Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, called</hi> Themiſtides? <hi>There is nothing eaſier, than to inform you,</hi> anſwers the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, <hi>You need only read the Characters that are about it. Ariamite</hi> reads them with an eager haſte, and ſees theſe words: Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <hi>Son of</hi> Leonidas, <hi>King of</hi> Sparta. <hi>How,</hi> added ſhe with aſtoniſhment, <hi>is that the Prince</hi> Cleomenes, <hi>of whom I have heard ſo much Diſcourſe. There is nothing more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Madam, replied the</hi> Athenian, <hi>his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture was drawn at the deſire of Queen</hi> Crete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilea, <hi>and the Painter has kept this Copy of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariamite</hi> meditates for ſome moments; ſhe afterwards affects to look upon ſeveral other pieces, which ſhe was in no very good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103174:63"/>to examine; and that ſhe might not make any diſcovery of the particular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſhe takes in <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> ſhe buys two or three Pictures more, beſides his. She feels a ſecret Joy, to know the real Condition of <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> and to imagine, that <hi>Leonidas</hi> will never conſent, that his Succeſſor may marry <hi>Cyleſira.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariamite</hi> conceives a longing deſire to come to the clearing of this matter with <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> and goes to walk in <hi>Timoleon</hi>'s Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, believing to find him there. She meets him indeed, and as ſhe perceives him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing himſelf, in order to enter into a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Grove. <hi>How!</hi> Themiſtides, ſays ſhe to him, <hi>do you fly from me? Do you forget that I am one of your Friends, by remembring only that</hi> Teleander <hi>is my Brother? Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers</hi> Cleomenes, <hi>a ſentiment of reſpect did forbid me to preſent my ſelf before you, and to let you ſee a Face, which the Intereſts of the Prince of</hi> Erymanthus <hi>might render odious to you. Ab,</hi> Themiſtides, <hi>replies ſhe, with an obliging languiſhing, you know that you are not hated, and if you would have me give a publick Teſtimony thereof, I conſent that you may walk with me.</hi> That proffer puts <hi>Clomenes</hi> into a Confuſion great enough, nevertheleſs he did not omit bowing, by way of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, and giving <hi>Ariamite</hi> his hand.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103174:63"/>The Princeſs walks ſome ſteps without ſpeaking, afterwards, looking <hi>Cleomenes</hi> in the Face; <hi>Confeſs,</hi> ſays ſhe to him, <hi>that this Garden ſeems to you a very Deſart; and that you would give all the People you ſee here, for one Perſon, whom you have not found. As I cannot diſſemble,</hi> replied the Prince, <hi>I confeſs unto you, Madam, that I would have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad to ſee</hi> Cyleſira; <hi>but it is a deſire that many others may have, as well as I. Perhaps they have not one ſo ſtrong, replies</hi> Ariamite <hi>in ſmiling: In the mean time,</hi> added ſhe with a more ſerious Air, <hi>I am amazed, that you ſhould be ſo affected with a Perſon, whom the great inequality of Condition will never ſuffer you to take to Wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She could not continue her Diſcourſe for Vexation. <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> for his part, was not very much at eaſe, to hear any more of it. But, in that moment, three or four of the principal Ladies of <hi>Corinth</hi> advanced towards <hi>Ariamite.</hi> The Princeſs failed not to receive them in a moſt obliging manner, and to walk along with them. <hi>Themiſtides</hi> did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe continue to lead <hi>Ariamite,</hi> and ſeveral, who ſaw that Prince with <hi>Teleander</hi>'s Siſter, were ſo ſurprized at it, as to talk of it in the Houſes, whither they afterwards went. So that thoſe News arrived at <hi>Onecryſa</hi>'s before <hi>Ariamite</hi> went out of the Garden; and in the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103174:64"/>Evening, when ſhe retired home, <hi>Teleander,</hi> being outragious with reſentment, was ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her Chamber to chide her.
<q>I would fain know, <hi>ſaies he,</hi> if you have the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to fear <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> and what reaſon obliges you to ſhew him any reſpect, when you ought to look upon him as our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Enemy?</q> 
               <hi>Ariamite,</hi> who expected this Diſcourſe, found her ſelf well enough pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to anſwer it.
<q>You are ſo impatient, <hi>ſaid ſhe to that Prince,</hi> that you well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be left in your Error. How! replies <hi>Teleander,</hi> much more enraged than before, dare you ſay that I am miſtaken? Don't you come from walking with a Man, who would have kill'd me, who would have wounded me, who has taken <hi>Cyleſira</hi> away from me? I confeſs it, replied <hi>Ariamite,</hi> and I do not pretend to make a ſecret to you of a thing, which all the World might have ſeen. I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling even to inform you of ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which no body elſe can do. You ſhall know, that I met with <hi>Themiſtides</hi> in <hi>Timoleon</hi>'s Garden; that I called him to me in an obliging manner; and that by ſome little marks of Complaiſance, which I thought fit to give him, I have kept him with me all the reſt of the day. He ſeeing himſelf very handſome, knowing himſelf brave, and believing that I have ſome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103174:64"/>and Conſideration for him, may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, flatter himſelf ſo far, as to pretend to my Affection. But if my Cares had the ſucceſs you ought to wiſh, would you ſtill be ſo unjuſt, as to complain of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct? Would you fancy that I deſire to give my ſelf to a Man unknown, and that I act, rather to render him Maſter of my own Deſtiny, than to deliver you from a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Rival.</q> 
               <hi>Teleander,</hi> inſtead of anſwering, made Reflections on what he heard; and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riamite</hi> renewing her Diſcourſe, ſaid,
<q>If I go yet further, and let you believe, that I do not hate <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> ſhould you be tormented at an Inclination that would u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite our Intereſts, that would make us act unanimouſly together, and that would give me a greater earneſtneſs to take off. <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides</hi> from <hi>Cyleſira?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Teleander,</hi> then looking on <hi>Ariamite</hi> with a little more moderation, anſwered; <hi>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs you might have been a very great aſſiſtance to me; but after all, what advantage can you gather from a Walk, which hath done you an injury, and given me ſo much vexation? I have diſcovered an Obſtacle, that will hinder your Rival to marry</hi> Leriana<hi>'s Daughter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied</hi> Ariamite, <hi>and I need ſay but one word to</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>to render her unfavourable to</hi> Themiſtides. <hi>Ah, Siſter, cried out</hi> Telean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103174:65"/>
               <hi>if that be ſo, Fortune ceaſes to be my Enemy. I am juſt now entruſted with a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, which aſſures me,</hi> Cyleſira <hi>can never be for</hi> Themiſtides, <hi>and I ſhall only need to diſcourſe with that Stranger, to make him turn his pretentions another way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Teleander</hi> and <hi>Ariamite</hi> deſired to declare ſeparately to <hi>Themiſtides</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> that which they had learnt of them both; and Chance had almoſt brought them to act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their own Intereſts. In effect, they are labouring for the Union of two Perſons, whom they have reſolved to ſeparate; for they ſtill kept as a ſecret what they had learnt. <hi>Teleander</hi> durſt not ſo ſoon fail, in what he promiſed <hi>Onecryſa;</hi> and <hi>Ariamite,</hi> for her part, would not tell her Brother, that he had a King's Son for his Rival. They did not deſire from each other any clearing of the matter, for fear of ſeeing themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to render Confidence for Confidence. To hope for a Fortunate ſucceſs, was enough to make them contented.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariamite</hi> went to viſit <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving carried her to her Bed-ſide, to ſpeak to her more privately, ſaid, <hi>I come to diſcover to you a Secret that I am intruſted with, and which it concerns you to know. I do not ask you if you love</hi> Themiſtides. <hi>I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that the Complaiſance he has for you,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103174:65"/>that his Meen, his Valour, and the Service he has rendred you at</hi> Egina, <hi>will never let you hate him. So that I being your real Friend, am obliged to give you notice, that if you give him your Heart, you will undergo moſt ſevere vexations.</hi> Themiſtides <hi>can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be yours. I know that you are of no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Family; I know likewiſe that you have all the Faſhions of a Perſon of an Illuſtrious Birth: But,</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>when you ſhall know</hi> Themiſtides, <hi>I think that you will not flatter your ſelf ſo far, as to pretend that he ſhould raiſe you up to his own Rank.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyleſira</hi> heard theſe laſt words with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of Joy, which ſhe could not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; and <hi>Ariamite,</hi> who perceived the ſigns of it in her Face, is ſurprized at it, holds her Tongue, and repents of having ſaid ſo much. Then changing all on the ſudden her Intentions, and even the tone of her Voice, <hi>Before I make an end of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming you,</hi> added ſhe, <hi>I may, methinks, ask you, what concern do you take in the News I bring you. I aſſure you, replied</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>you cannot pleaſe me better, than by telling me, that</hi> Themiſtides<hi>'s Merit is ſupported by a high Birth. I am very glad, replied</hi> Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, <hi>to find you of that Opinion, and I ſhould be much more glad, if what I ſaid, had any other Foundation than my own Conjectures.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103174:66"/>But,</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>to ſpeak ſincerely to you, I am not, as yet, confirmed in them, and you will be pleaſed that I inform my ſelf better, before I make you Confident of a matter, that is not not, perhaps, too true.</hi> She afterwards calls <hi>Leriana,</hi> tells her that ſhe may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and ſays, that the Company will be better, than if it conſiſted only in thoſe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Maiden ſecrets, that uſually ſignifie nothing. She continues to hide her vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſoon after goes away, becauſe ſhe would not conſtrain her ſelf any longer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Teleander,</hi> for his part, gave his Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Order to viſit <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him from himſelf to come and walk in <hi>Timoleon</hi>'s Garden. The Gentleman entred into ſome ſuſpition, and before he went to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> he gave <hi>Onecryſa</hi> notice of the Commiſſion, wherewith he was charged. The Princeſs of <hi>Erymanthus</hi> was allarmed at it. She ran to <hi>Aratus,</hi> and conjured him to be himſelf preſent in the ſame Garden, and to prevent thoſe Rivals, from proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once more to ſome dangerous debate.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the two Princes met in a Green-Arbour, and after having ſaluted each other with an Air ſufficiently cold, <hi>Telean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> began to ſpeak after this manner. <hi>I do not know,</hi> Themiſtides, <hi>what thoughts you believe I have of you. The advantages you
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103174:66"/>have gained over me, may perſwade you, that I regard you with envy, and that there is ſtill ſome reſentment remaining in my Heart. But I ſuppoſe that you have Generoſity enough to believe, that I do not altogether want that Virtue, and that I can ſhew a juſt eſteem for Valour, even when it ruins my own underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings. Nevertheleſs, let us talk no more of what has paſſed between us, in a time, when we are likely to ſee the Cauſe of the averſion which we have for each other ceaſe. You ſhall no longer ſee in me the ſame earneſtneſs after</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>and I dare ſay, that for your part, you are about to moderate your Paſſion, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing your Hopes. I perceive well enough, that theſe News are not very pleaſing to you, but ſince they may cauſe you to avoid greater Sorrows, you will not be troubled, that I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them. Know that</hi> Cyleſira <hi>is not deſigned for you, and that ſhe is very ſuddenly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the Happineſs of another. Ah! Sir, interrupted</hi> Cleomenes <hi>with a Sigh! it is the thing, I fear, and by reaſon thereof, I have deſpair already in my Soul. You are then bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſtructed, than I imagined, replied</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leander, <hi>in what Concerns</hi> Cyleſira; <hi>and you know, probably, that ſhe is of a deſcent, that places her above your Pretentions.</hi> Theſe laſt words were ſo little ſuitable with the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, which the firſt had been capable of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103174:67"/>giving upon the account of <hi>Democares,</hi> that <hi>Themiſtides</hi> was by them reaſſured in his mind, and renewed again the diſcourſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his real Sentiments. <hi>How joyful ſhould I be, ſays he, to ſee</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>in the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which her Charms and Merit ſeem to exact from Fortune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As they were going on with their diſcourſe, the General of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> who was in ſearch for <hi>Teleander,</hi> entred into the Arbour, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no mark of Animoſity in the Faces of the two Princes, he ſaid, <hi>I am very glad to ſee you together, and I do not doubt but you have changed the ſentiments you had for each other. And indeed you have no other reſolution to take, ſince</hi> Cyleſira <hi>is upon the point of departing, never to return any more into this Country. But, believe me, and comfort your ſelves, by courting a Miſtreſs that will be more grateful than</hi> Cyleſira <hi>can be. She, I mean, recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all her Lovers, and if they die for her, they receive a Price of greater value, than the Life they loſe. You will be of my Opinion, when you judge that I ſpeak of Glory, and of the Immortality which ſhe beſtows. Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied</hi> Themiſtides, <hi>I confeſs, that the Miſtreſs whom you mean, has a great Splendour; neither do I wonder, that the Illuſtrious</hi> Aratus, <hi>who is one of her Principal Favourites, has a deſire to attract all the world to her Service. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103174:67"/>I do not believe, that you doubt, that the Prince of</hi> Erymanthus <hi>and my ſelf are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready touched with her Charms. But Sir, added</hi> Teleander, <hi>'tis not forbidden to have a particular Miſtreſs, together with that almoſt univerſal one; and if</hi> Themiſtides <hi>and my ſelf were not afraid of ſome great Obſtacles to our pretentions on</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>nothing would be more pleaſant to us, than to love that fair Lady with Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aratus</hi> judged by that anſwer, that <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryſa</hi> had diſcovered too much to <hi>Teleander,</hi> and that even <hi>Teleander</hi> had already told <hi>The miſtides Cyleſira</hi>'s Deſcent. He was vext at it, and feared, leſt the ſecret, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Princeſs, ſhould chance to be entirely diſcovered, before her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>
            <p>In the Evening, <hi>Teleander</hi> went into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riamite</hi>'s Chamber, and asked her if ſhe had ſpoken with <hi>Cyleſira. For my own part, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, I have been interrupted by</hi> Aratus, <hi>but I want only the ſaying of two words, to take off</hi> Themiſtides. <hi>Thoſe two words, replied</hi> Ariamite <hi>coldly, muſt be of very great Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, if you hope from them ſuch an Event. Since you have a ſhare in my Concerns, replied</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leander, <hi>I will not keep them ſecret from you. Know then that</hi> Cyleſira <hi>is a Princeſs; and that ſhe is very ſpeedily to aſcend a Throne.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103174:68"/>You ſee I need only give this notice to</hi> Themiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des—<hi>Ah! Dear Brother, interrupted ſhe, do not diſcover that Secret, otherwiſe you may render</hi> Themiſtides <hi>a better Office than you imagine. Know in your turn, that your Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val is himſelf a Prince, and that it is</hi> Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes, <hi>the Son of King</hi> Leonidas, <hi>whom we ſee every day, under the borrowed name of</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtides. <hi>If you doubt of it, added ſhe, in ſhewing</hi> Cleomenes <hi>Picture, ſee here, what will convince you.</hi>—Teleander <hi>looked upon it with wonder; he felt new diſquiets, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that</hi> Themiſtides <hi>and</hi> Cyleſira <hi>muſt by no means know, that they are of an equal Condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the Morrow <hi>Aratus</hi> went to viſit <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giatis,</hi> and adviſed her to depart as ſoon as ſhe could. The Princeſs conſented to it, in ſpight of the Melancholly ſhe had in her Heart. She was amazed at her own diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, and forgot nothing to appeaſe them. She ſaid within her ſelf; that ſhe was going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to ſee Prince <hi>Gilipus;</hi> but if in that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe durſt ſay, ſhe was going to remove from <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> ſhe became ſenſible of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which ſhe could not overcome. At length ſhe follows a ſecret movement, that inclines her to comfort her ſelf, and imagines, that being ſo highly obliged to <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> ſhe could not with decency part for ever from
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103174:68"/>him, without giving him ſome mark of her acknowledgment. She took in hand Pen and Paper, but as that Novelty perplexed her, ſhe was at ſome loſs in ſeeking out ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, that without either having too much force, or being too weak, might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely anſwer her intentions.</p>
            <p>She had hardly ended her Letter, when <hi>Leriana</hi> came into her Cloſet, and ſaid to her, <hi>Madam, You are not ignorant of what Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents</hi> Themiſtides <hi>and</hi> Teleander <hi>have for you, and you have ſeen with what haſte they are returned from</hi> Palenis, <hi>in ſpite of their Wounds. I queſtion not, if they can but know what way you will take, but that they will take the ſame themſelves, and follow you to</hi> Erabeus, <hi>and even to</hi> Lacedemon. <hi>Conſider, whether they are in a Condition to undertake that voyage without danger, and even whether they are not likely to be carried to ſome extremity, in order to oppoſe the intentions of Prince</hi> Gilipus, <hi>and the happineſs of King</hi> Agis. <hi>Be, I intreat you, cautious, and aſſure your ſelf, that I ſhall not be wanting on my part. Agiatis</hi> approved of <hi>Leriana</hi>'s Reaſons, gave her Letter, together with an Order that it ſhould not be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red until two dayes after her departure, and on the morrow very early in the morning ſhedeparts from <hi>Corinth,</hi> together with <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſthenes, Leriana,</hi> and ſome of <hi>Aratus</hi>'s Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103174:69"/>The Report was at firſt ſpread, that <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> was returned to <hi>Palenis;</hi> ſome Domeſtick Servants, whom he left behind in his Houſe, confirmed thoſe News, and ſaid, that their Maſter was to return in two dayes. But <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> walking in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in <hi>Timoleon's</hi> Garden, was inform'd, that <hi>Leriana</hi>'s Chariot took a way very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that towards <hi>Egina.</hi> He was ſo diſpleaſed at it, that <hi>Philiſtion</hi> grew appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, it might create vexatious conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>have you a mind, that your diſquiets be more fatal to you, than your Wounds have been? You are not yet tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly cured, but if you had recovered ſtrength enough, to go in ſearch of what you love, would you, through Grief, caſt your ſelf into a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous relapſe?</hi> Theſe words made ſome impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s trouble was not ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, but that there ſtill remained ſome marks of it in his Countenance. <hi>Ariamite</hi> accompanied by a certain Woman of Quality, who was her Confident, met the Prince, and obſerved the Melancholly he had in his Eyes. <hi>I do not doubt,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>but that it is</hi> Cyleſira's <hi>departure, that makes you ſad; but give me leave,</hi> Themiſtides, <hi>to wonder at it. For indeed,</hi> added ſhe, <hi>moſt dextrouſly, if that Stranger has for you thoſe ſentiments of eſteem, which no Perſon ought to deny you, and if ſhe
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103174:69"/>has retained a true Gratitude for the ſervice which you have rendred her, ſhe has told you in what place you may find her. But if on the contrary, ſhe has failed to give you this advice, ſhould you not regard her as an ungrateful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who renders her ſelf unworthy of your ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs? But, Madam, replied</hi> Clomenes <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly, I do not ſee that</hi> Cyleſira <hi>is ſo much in my debt, as you imagine. I only gave her an aſſiſtance, which ſhe might expect from any other beſides</hi> Themiſtides. <hi>I believe, replied</hi> Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, <hi>that any other would have leſs expoſed himſelf, than you, and that even you would not have fought with ſo much ardour, for any other than</hi> Cyleſira. <hi>But after all, Sir, if</hi> Themiſtides <hi>blindly loves</hi> Leriana<hi>'s Daughter, 'tis time that the Prince</hi> Cleomenes, <hi>that the Son of King</hi> Leonidas <hi>ſhould open his Eyes, to ſee, to what, a more Glorious Deſtiny calls him. How, Madam! do you know me?</hi> interrupted the Prince with ſurpriſe. <hi>Yes, Sir, I know you, replied</hi> Ariamite, <hi>and have even ſome concern for you. You know that there is a ſtrict Alliance between the</hi> Spartans <hi>and the</hi> Achaians, <hi>and that</hi> Aratus <hi>has ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Friends in</hi> Lacedemon. <hi>If his mediation be neceſſary to you, I will forget nothing that way incline him to make an accommodation that may be for your advantage. Indeed, Sir, added</hi> Ariamite<hi>'s Friend, if you have ſome
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103174:70"/>merit, it muſt be alſo confeſt, that you have a great deal of good Fortune. To be convinced of it, you need only examine the Words, and Eyes of this fair Princeſs. Obſerve her Charms, and if I may preſume to ſay it, added ſhe in a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Voice, addict your ſelf to her. Poſſibly you ſhall ſee, that ſhe will not want acknowledgment for the Prince</hi> Cleomenes. <hi>So that, Sir, the Princeſs</hi> Ariamite, <hi>may eaſily comfort you, for the loſs of</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>and the King</hi> Leonidas <hi>will be better ſatisfied with an Alliance with</hi> Aratus, <hi>than with that with</hi> Leriana. Theſe words made <hi>Ariamite</hi> bluſh, add a new luſter to her Complexion, and render even her Air more moving. That Prince, who was by Nature Sprightly and Bold, appeared Timorous and Baſhful on this occaſion. She caſt down her Eyes to the ground, and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently expected <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s anſwer. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtides</hi> was too ſincere, he was too much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with <hi>Cyleſira</hi>'s Charms, to give cauſe of believing that he would change his Paſſion; but he was alſo far from having any thing that was diſobliging in his Humour; He anſwered with all the Signs of Reſpect and Gratitude he could give. <hi>I know,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>how much I am bound to ſo fair a Princeſs. And with what Sentiments I ought to remember her all my life. Nevertheleſs ſince ſhe is no longer ignorant who I am, ſhe ſees, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103174:70"/>to</hi> Leonidas, <hi>to diſpoſe of</hi> Cleomenes<hi>'s Deſtiny.</hi> Then he thought it proper, to ſhew her the Letter he had received from the King his Father. He was willing to give <hi>Ariamite</hi> this Teſtimony of Confidence, and to ſpare her the double vexation ſhe would conceive for his departure, if ſhe ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he left <hi>Corinth</hi> ſo ſpeedily, to no other end, than to run after <hi>Cyleſira.</hi> The Princeſs had no ſooner read over <hi>Leonidas</hi>'s Letter, but, looking on <hi>Cleomenes</hi> with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging languiſhing, ſhe ſaid to him, <hi>Then you are, Sir, going to leave us, and in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility you will never be ſeen more in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Yet if you chance to return, with the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours with which your Republick is bound to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us, you ſhall ſee what Conſideration we ſhall have for you. We ſhall poſſibly render you good Offices, over and above thoſe that are due to your Rank and Merit. Cleomenes</hi> was moved with theſe words of <hi>Arimite</hi>'s, and he was even ſenſible of ſome Regret, in parting from her.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs he did not fail to propoſe a ſpeedy departure to <hi>Xenares,</hi> and believed that he was called to <hi>Tegeum,</hi> no leſs by his Love, than by the Orders of <hi>Leonidas.</hi> He was in hopes, that he needed only ſend to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> to be informed, where he might ſee that fair <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> who was appointed for
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103174:71"/>
               <hi>Democares.</hi> He went to take his leave of <hi>Aratus, Onecryſa,</hi> and <hi>Ariamite.</hi> The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the <hi>Achaians</hi> careſſed him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Merit of <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> and paid him all the Honours that were due to <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Ariamite</hi> could not with dry Eyes ſee that Prince go out of her Apartment, and <hi>Teleander,</hi> who was vext to ſee him depart ſo ſoon after <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> was willing to avoid the bidding him adieu, and was therefore gone a walking to the Caſtle of <hi>Acrocorinth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Evening <hi>Cyleſira</hi>'s Letter was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to <hi>Themiſtides.</hi> The Prince kiſſed the Paper, opened it with a joy he never felt before, and found in it theſe words.</p>

                     <hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R Journey was ſo ſpeedily reſolved upon, that I had not time to ſpeak to you of it.

You will ſoon be informed of this Truth, and at that time, you will believe me much happier, than I ſhall really be. This is all I can tell you,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103174:71"/>unleſs I add, that I am not deſigned for</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocares, <hi>and that there is a great difference between the Sentiments I have for him, and the Eſteem and Gratitude I ſhall all my Life preſerve for the Generous</hi> Themiſtides.</p>

               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had no ſooner made an end of reading it, but he read it over again, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his Pleaſure. He then grew a little Melancholly, becauſe he could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the whole meaning of the Letter. But that he might be in a better Condition, to reſiſt the Fatigues of his Journey, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to appeaſe all the troubles of his Mind. He hoped that <hi>Cyleſira</hi> may entruſt him at <hi>Lacedemon</hi> with the ſecret, which ſhe had ſo much a mind to diſcover to him at <hi>Egina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He departed. <hi>Philiſtion</hi> followed him, and promiſed never to part from him. The Prince was overjoyed at it, and expreſſed ſo much to him, by careſſing him, while he waited for an opportunity of beſtowing on him other marks of his Gratitude. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his firſt cares, to learn what way <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſira</hi> had taken. He inſtructed <hi>Erantor,</hi> and ſent him away to that purpoſe; but <hi>Leria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> had taken ſuch heed, by the continual
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103174:72"/>changing of Roads, and Chariots, that it was impoſſible to trace her. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> was very much troubled at it, and <hi>Philiſtion</hi> was forced to repreſent, that he would infallibly hear ſome News of her, by the means of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At length the Prince arrived at <hi>Tegeum,</hi> he found there a great number of conſiderable Citizens, who had withdrawn themſelves thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be near <hi>Leonidas Cleomenes</hi> was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Creteſilea</hi> his Mother, and <hi>Cheloniſa</hi> his Siſter, with tears of Joy. The King would at firſt, have concealed part of his tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but he was not maſter of the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Heart, at the ſight of a Son, I ſay of a Son, ſo handſom, and who already did ſo well anſwer, by his actions, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations that were had of him. He preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Cleomenes</hi> between his Arms, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards received <hi>Xenares</hi> and <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> with all the Honour they could expect, and asked them ſome Circumſtances of what had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>Egina. Cleomenes</hi> bluſht, and <hi>Xena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> ſmilingly anſwered, <hi>I can tell you better than the Prince, the Beauty of his action; but he will tell you better than I, that the Lady whom they would have carried away, is the moſt Charming Creature he may have ever ſeen. I underſtand you, replied</hi> Leonidas with the ſame Air; <hi>but, Prince,</hi> added he,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:103174:72"/>addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Cleomenes, I am very much miſtaken, if I do not ſuddenly make you forget what you have ſeen in</hi> Egina. <hi>I have framed a great deſign, which I hope to execute, and I promiſe you, that the ſucceſs of it will giue you the Poſſeſſion of a Princeſs, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the admiration of all the Earth. Sir, replied</hi> Cleomenes, <hi>I am, as yet, to think of nothing, but of ſerving my King. You ſhall ſee, interrupted</hi> Leonidas, <hi>that what both you and I deſire, are not incompatible.</hi> In that moment <hi>Leonidas</hi> ſaw one of the moſt Zealous of his Faction enter, who was come from <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> he advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, and took him aſide. Then he ſaid to him, <hi>Well,</hi> Megabates, <hi>what have you to tell me of</hi> Agis? <hi>Are you informed of his Deſigns? Sir,</hi> anſwered he, Agis <hi>will at preſent put nothing in Execution, but what relates to the ſuppreſſing of Debts: He has put off the making a Partition of Goods, until he returns from</hi> Aratus<hi>'s Army, whither, you know, he is to lead the ſuccours, which we have obliged to give the</hi> Achaians. <hi>This firſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe does not take away from the principal Citizens of the Republick, either their Lands, or Houſes, and ſeems only to tend to the eaſe of the People. So that your Faction, who are ſpoiled leſs than they apprehended, will not poſſibly be enraged enough to take up Arms, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103174:73"/>I know not whether you had not better wait for a more favourable occaſion. I believe, as well as you, replied</hi> Leonidas, <hi>that Matters are not yet well enough diſpoſed to bring me back; but I would not have the two Branches of the Family of the</hi> Agiades <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite by this Marriage, upon which they are reſolved. I do not know that I can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take any thing more advantageous to my Houſe, than to make</hi> Agiatis <hi>enter into it. I ſhould deprive thereby the Prince, to whom ſhe is deſigned, of a great reinforcement; and he who would eſpouſe her, ſhould, at length, have the Wealth and Friends of</hi> Gilipus. <hi>I know that</hi> Agiatis <hi>is returned to</hi> Erabeus, <hi>and that</hi> Gilipus <hi>is, in a few days, to carry her to</hi> Lacedemon, <hi>in order to be Married. He little imagines, that I am ſo perfectly informed of every thing, that relates to his Daughter; but I have always had my mind ſo firmly bent upon the deſign I am now declaring to you, that I have forgot nothing that may make it ſucceed. I have gained an Inhabitant of</hi> Megalopolis, <hi>called</hi> Crantippus, <hi>who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every day at</hi> Erabeus, <hi>and he gives me an account of every thing that paſſes there. As ſoon as</hi> Agiatis <hi>was returned thither, he did not fail to ſend me the news of it, and I, for my part, redoubled my Liberality, becauſe I perceive, that it is now that I have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103174:73"/>need of his aſſiſtance. It would not be difficult for you, replied</hi> Megabates, <hi>to take away the Princeſs from thence by force, whilſt that</hi> Agis <hi>and</hi> Gilipus <hi>are buſied with their Friends at</hi> Lacedemon. <hi>That is it, replied</hi> Leonidas, <hi>that I have a longing deſire to do, and to ſpeak unto you freely, you would do me an infinite pleaſure, in being willing to be the Chief of that enterprize. I will give you the Command of my Guards; you ſhall take ſuch a number of them as you think fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and having cauſed them to enter ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately into</hi> Megalopolis, <hi>you ſhall take ſuch meaſures with</hi> Crantippus, <hi>as you ſhall judge neceſſary for the Execution of my deſign. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabates</hi> did let him know, he would omit nothing that might tend to the ſucceſsful accompliſhment of that important Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and <hi>Leonidas,</hi> relying upon his Conduct, thought of nothing, but how he ſhould te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> with what Care and Pains he laboured for his Intereſts. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after the Prince, and was informed, that, after he had entertained, for ſome time, the Queen with the particulars of his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he was gone out to walk with <hi>Philiſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was that he might talk with him about <hi>Cyleſira. My Dear,</hi> Philiſtion, ſaid <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, I intreat you to depart to morrow for</hi> Lacedemon, <hi>to go to</hi> Democares<hi>'s Houſe, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103174:74"/>to enquire there, in what place I may find her I love. You have a pretence to ask that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, without ſaying any thing contrary to the Truth. You may ſay that you are of</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, <hi>that you have known</hi> Leriana <hi>there, and that you would be glad to ſee her again in that Country, into which, you have been told, ſhe is returned. Yes, Sir, replied</hi> Philiſtion, <hi>I will go to</hi> Sparta, <hi>and I will ſee</hi> Democa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, <hi>and it ſhall not be my Fault, if I get not from him the information you deſire.</hi>

            <p>He departed at the hour that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> ordered him to do; and as ſoon as he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he learnt that <hi>Democares</hi> was not in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and that none knew, either where he was, or when he would return. <hi>Philiſtion</hi> was troubled at it, and he gave an account thereof to <hi>Cleomenes</hi> in a Letter. While he ſtaid at <hi>Lacedemon</hi> for an anſwer to it, the Prince found himſelf in a ſtrange perplexity at <hi>Tegeum.</hi> The King, his Father, declared to him the deſign he had of taking away <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giatis</hi> by force, in order to beſtow her on him; and even told him the particulars of thoſe meaſures which he had taken with <hi>Megabates. Cleomenes,</hi> who had an averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Injuſtice, and could love no other Woman than <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> did, at firſt, oppoſe <hi>Leonidas</hi>'s Intentions, and throwing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at his Feet, ſaid to him,
<q>In the name
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103174:74"/>of Heaven, Sir, let not the Goodneſs you have for me, tranſport you to act vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. For God's ſake conſider, that the Princeſs <hi>Agiatis</hi> would hate me mortally, and that ſhe would always regard me, as the Son of her Raviſher. Does it belong to you, replied <hi>Leonidas</hi> ſeverely, to make ſuch Remonſtrances to me, when I take care of your Intereſts? Shall we ever have ſuch an opportunity as this is, which you would have us loſe? Is there ſo fair a Princeſs in all <hi>Greece?</hi> Can you make a more important Alliance? But, Sir, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied</hi> Cleomenes <hi>boldly,</hi> who can aſſure you that this Rape will not arm all the <hi>Agiades</hi> againſt you, inſtead of uniting them to you? I will once more anſwer you, <hi>replied</hi> Leonidas, but, after that, I command you to hold your Tongue, and withdraw. You apprehend that <hi>Agis</hi> and <hi>Gilipus</hi> may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Enemies. Are they not already ſo? Have we not room to hope, that their reſentment will have no conſequence; that they will conſent to a Peace, and that they would be very loth to ruine a Family, to which <hi>Agiatis</hi> will give Heirs and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</q> 
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> did not approve of theſe Reaſons, but ſince <hi>Leonidas</hi> had ſtopt his Mouth, he durſt ſay no more, but retired with a moſt ſenſible diſpleaſure. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103174:75"/>not only never to Marry <hi>Agiatis;</hi> but he did even believe that he ſhould be on Accomplice of the Crime, which they would have him commit, if he did not do his endeavours to prevent the Execution of it. He ſecured to himſelf ſecretly ſome People, and makes himſelf ready to march to <hi>Agiatis</hi>'s aſſiſtance, as ſoon as it would be time convenient.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Democares</hi> arrived at <hi>Erabeus;</hi> he had told <hi>Gilipus,</hi> that he went to <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> and that he would viſit <hi>Agia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> in paſſing by; in the mean time he had left <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> with no other Intentions, than to ſee that Princeſs. He had a violent Paſſion for her, and did only counterfeit a Love for the true <hi>Cyleſira, Leriana</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he might be the more agreeably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by <hi>Gilipus.</hi> But, in this laſt Journey, he found <hi>Agiatis</hi>'s Beauty ſo increaſed, that he was no longer Maſter of thoſe Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he had always, till then, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. The Princeſs was alone in her Chamber, and the ſweetneſs with which ſhe entertained <hi>Democares,</hi> finiſht his ruine.
<q>You cannot believe, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> how kindly I take it from you, that you are the firſt, that comes to viſit us. 'Tis true, <hi>Cyleſira</hi>'s obliging anſwer, which we ſent from the Iſle of <hi>Egina,</hi> did well deſerve
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103174:75"/>that you ſhould make ſuch haſte to thank her. I know, <hi>replied</hi> Democares, what are my Obligations to <hi>Leriana</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira;</hi> but, Madam, they will be pleaſed, before I return them my thanks, that I expreſs to you the Joy I receive for your return, and for ſeeing you more Charming than ever.</q> He accompanied theſe words with a look paſſionate enough, to explain the whole ſenſe of them; and the Princeſs having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended <hi>Democares</hi> but too well, anſwered imperiouſly. 'Know, that I am no longer called <hi>Cyleſira;</hi> I have quitted that name in entering <hi>Erabeus,</hi> and you will not do ill to obſerve, that it is to <hi>Agiatis</hi> you ſpeak.
<q>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, I am willing to forget, or even not to have underſtood what there was offenſive in your Diſcourſe; provided you have for <hi>Cyleſira</hi>—For Heaven's ſake, <hi>interrupted he,</hi> do not go through with your Command of the onely thing in which I cannot obey you. Though I ſhould offend you by a Declaration, which God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes themſelves do not always receive as an Affront, yet I will not delay one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from telling you, that I am the firſt, whom your budding Beauty has made to ſigh, and that I will love you, during my whole Life. Since you have loſt your Reaſon, <hi>replied</hi> Agiatis, <hi>more enraged than
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103174:76"/>before,</hi> be gone, and never preſume to ſee me more, unleſs you will have me complain of your inſolence, to ſome perſons, who will be able to puniſh you for it. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand you, <hi>replied he,</hi> but tell <hi>Agis</hi> and <hi>Gilipus</hi> what you pleaſe, I fear their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er leſs than your Anger. I confeſs that I am no King; but I have Courage; I have Friends; I live in a Free State; I can be <hi>Ephore;</hi> and by conſequence I can raiſe my ſelf to Charges, whoſe Authority is above that of Kings. After this, Madam, I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, but remember that you have ſcorned <hi>Democares,</hi> and that I will attempt ſo many wayes, as not to deſpair to ſee you one day depend on my Will. Then he went away in Fury, and even with a Threatning Meen.</q>

               <hi>Leoſthenes, Leriana,</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> whom <hi>Agiatis</hi> had ſent for, entred the Room with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Minute after, and obſerved with ſurprize that the Princeſs's Countenance was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily moved. Their aſtoniſhment was increaſed, as ſoon as <hi>Agiatis</hi> related what had paſſed.
<q>You know, Madam, <hi>ſaid</hi> Leriana <hi>to her,</hi> by whoſe Order we ſuffered <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cares</hi>'s Viſits. 'Twas that I might not diſpleaſe Prince <hi>Gilipus,</hi> that I my ſelf incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Cyleſira</hi> to ſhew him ſome Complaiſance, and to make him the laſt anſwer, which
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103174:76"/>you ſaw in the Iſle of <hi>Egina.</hi> Nevertheleſs I had ſome Reluctancy, to give my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a man whoſe Humour I knew bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Prince <hi>Gilipus.</hi> I was more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to examine him, and <hi>Democares</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained himſelf leſs before me. I perceived him to be Reſtleſs, Ambitious, a lover of Novelties. I knew alſo that he was Bold, and Undertaking, and that he had but little Judgment, with a great deal of Courage. I am therefore very glad that I am delivered from the continual fear, wherein I ſhould have been, if Fortune had matched my Daughter to <hi>Democares.</hi> But I am very ſorry to underſtand, that he has thoſe Sentiments for you which you ſay he has. I know that his Audacity is extream, that his Friends are not few in Number, and that there is nothing as yet peaceable in <hi>Lacedemon.</hi> I ſee that, as well as you, <hi>repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Princeſs,</hi> and I perceive that I ſhall never be very happy. But indeed, I can take no other Meaſures, than to conceal from Prince <hi>Gilipus,</hi> that <hi>Democares</hi> has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended me, for fear of dividing and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening Our Party in ſo dangerous a Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. Since it is not <hi>Democares,</hi> who has reaſon to complain, we need fear nothing for the preſent, and we will be leſs afraid, when <hi>Agis</hi>'s Authority ſhall be better eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</q>

            <p>While <hi>Agiatis</hi> was thus diſcourſing about <hi>Democares,</hi> that <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> grown outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous with his Reſentment, ſtudied nothing but Revenge. His firſt intention was to throw himſelf into <hi>Leonidas</hi>'s Party, and to draw into it <hi>Amphares, Arcecilaus,</hi> and all the reſt of his Friends. He took Pleaſure in ſhewing the Princeſs what he could do, and what a man ſhe had loſt; he imagined he could occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a Change great enough in <hi>Sparta</hi> to make <hi>Agiatis</hi> repent. But in a few Moments after, his love more violent than before, would not permit him to break with <hi>Gilipus,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce for ever a Lady's ſight, with whom he was Charmed.</p>
            <p>He went as far as <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> and was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad to ſhew himſelf there to ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who might tell <hi>Gilipus</hi> of his Journey. He being acquainted with <hi>Crantippus</hi> at <hi>Erabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> went to his houſe, talked to him of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giatis,</hi> and could not forbear to complain of her.
<q>When you ſhall ſee her, <hi>purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he,</hi> you will do me a kindneſs, to appear ſurprized at the Manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe entertained me, and to let her underſtand, that there may proceed terrible conſequences from that Affront.</q> 
               <hi>Crantip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> promiſed to do him that good Office, and to talk to the Princeſs very earneſtly in his behalf.</p>

                  </gap>rantippus,</hi> diſcovered to him the deſign that brought him thither, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with him how to put it in Execution. <hi>Crantippus</hi> went on the Morrow to <hi>Erabeus,</hi> told the Princeſs of <hi>Democares</hi>'s Reſentment, and gave her to underſtand that a man of his Humour might be tranſported to ſome vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. <hi>Agiatis</hi> anſwered, that ſhe was far from fearing him, ſince it was in her power to make <hi>Democares</hi> repent, that he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven any offence to a Perſon of her Rank. <hi>Crantippus,</hi> who was very deſirous to divide <hi>Agis</hi>'s Party, told the Princeſs, that he did not doubt but that ſhe had already given no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it to the Prince <hi>Gilipus,</hi> and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her that ſhe ought not neglect the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. He remained the reſt of the day at <hi>Erabeus,</hi> and in the Night he ſet on Fire a part of the Houſe. Thoſe whom he had gained to act jointly with him, gave the Alarm, ſaid that <hi>Democares</hi> would have burnt <hi>Erabeus,</hi> and that he appeared in the Neighbourhood with a Body of Horſe, <hi>Ah! Madam,</hi> cried out <hi>Crantippus, I was very much in the right, when I ſaid that you were to fear every thing from that deſperate Man. Save your ſelf, Madam, come to</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galopolis <hi>with</hi> Leriana, <hi>I will conduct you with a ſmall Train, the better to conceal your flight,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103174:78"/>and</hi> Leoſthenes <hi>ſhall amuſe</hi> Democares, <hi>either by ſome reſiſtance, or by ſome kind of Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Leoſthenes</hi> approved of that Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and the Princeſs was hardly two Leagues from <hi>Erabeus,</hi> when <hi>Megabates</hi> accoſts her at the Head of twenty Horſemen. <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>you do not fall into</hi> Democares<hi>'s hands. I have Orders to carry you to a Prince who will regard you more as his own Daughter, than as his Enemy. 'Tis to King</hi> Leonidas, <hi>added</hi> Crantippus, <hi>and I am ſure you will have no reaſon to complain of what he deſigns for you. Agiatis</hi> perceived that <hi>Crantippus</hi> had laid the Snare for her, into which ſhe was fallen, and not being able to hear him, ſhe interrupted him with Indignation. <hi>Perfidious Wretch,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>doſt thou believe that Heaven will ſuffer thy Treachery to go unpuniſhed?</hi> She had hardly finiſht theſe words, when ſhe ſaw ten or twelve Horſemen appear, who came from the Coaſt towards <hi>Alpheus.</hi> He, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Chief of them, rode up to <hi>Megaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> and intreated him to ſet the Princeſs <hi>Agiatis</hi> at Liberty. <hi>Megabates</hi> conſidered the Cavalier, entred into ſome ſuſpicion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelf with anſwering in theſe Terms. <hi>If you are of the Princeſs's intereſt, you will not oppoſe our March. The liberty that you require for her, would be leſs advantageous to her than you imagine. 'Tis not ſo much your part as her
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103174:78"/>own, to judge of her advantages,</hi> replied the Cavalier, <hi>and ſince I am perſwaded ſhe will pleaſe her ſelf better in her own houſe, than in the place into which you pretend to carry her. I deſire ſhe may be conveyed back to</hi> Erabeus. <hi>However ſhe ſhall take another way now, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Crantippus. <hi>If ſhe had no other Conductors than ſuch as you,</hi> replied the unknown Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, <hi>I do not think you ſhould carry her far.</hi> In that very moment they took their Swords in hand, and began to fight. <hi>Crantippus</hi> made at him with a thruſt, but the unknown Cavalier diſcharged ſo furious a back blow acroſs his Head, that he made him fall down without any Life. He afterwards threw himſelf on <hi>Megabates</hi>'s Troop, and felled to the ground the firſt he met: But having received a hurt with a Javelin, His own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could not ſuffer either him to expoſe himſelf, or men of the ſame Party to come to blows among themſelves. They cried out to <hi>Megabates</hi> that it was <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and that he had better give <hi>Agiatis</hi> her Liberty, than to let the Prince expoſe himſelf to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>

               <hi>Megabates,</hi> who had already ſuſpected what was told him, did eaſily believe it, and being careful of <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Life.

            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Megabates</hi> is afraid of <hi>Leonidas,</hi> and repreſents to <hi>Cleomenes</hi> that he has acted no leſs againſt his own Intereſts, than againſt his Father's Will and Pleaſure. <hi>Sir,</hi> purſues he, <hi>though your Wounds would not ſtay you at</hi> Megalopolis, <hi>I doubt whether or no we ſhould go to</hi> Tegeum. <hi>I believe that what has now happened, will give us no very good reception there, and I confeſs I had much rather write to the King, concerning the Succeſs of this undertaking, than go and give an account of it my ſelf.

            <p>They afterwards continue their way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> and as ſoon as they arrive there, the Prince puts himſelf into Bed. His Wound was ſearched, and found not dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and <hi>Megabates</hi> ſent back his Men to <hi>Tegeum</hi> with a Letter to <hi>Leonidas.</hi> That Prince was tranſported with anger againſt <hi>Cleomenes:</hi> He declared aloud he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee him: He forbid the Queen to ſend for him back; and yet he recalled <hi>Megaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.

            </p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Democares</hi> arrived at <hi>Sparta;</hi> He ſaw <hi>Gilipus,</hi> and when that Prince enquired of him what News from <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beus? Sir,</hi> anſwered he, <hi>the Princeſs is more Charming than I can expreſs unto you; and as I intereſs my ſelf in every thing that has relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to you, I was exceeding glad to ſee that Augmentation of Beauty. But I muſt confeſs, that I have no great reaſon to applaud the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, after which the Princeſs received thoſe Teſtimonies I gave her of it. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe took what I ſaid for a piece of Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that ſhe ought not to ſuffer, or whether by</hi> Lerianas <hi>inſtructions ſhe carries her diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion even to Coyneſs; but be it which it will, I have been treated with a moſt intolerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity,

<q>You ſtrangely ſurpriſe me, interrupted <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipus,</hi> I never believed <hi>Agiatis</hi> was of that humour, or that ſhe would receive, in ſuch a manner, the beſt of my friends. But we will go within theſe two or three days to <hi>Erabeus,</hi> and you ſhall ſee how I pretend you ſhould be reſpected there. Ah, Sir, <hi>replied</hi> Democares, for God's ſake, do not tell the Princeſs that I make any Complaint againſt her; it would be but to exaſperate her the more, and after that, I ſhould go to your Houſe with an extream Reluctancy.</q> 
               <hi>Gilipus</hi> promiſed him to do nothing in that matter, without his Conſent, and yet, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a great Eſteem for him, and ſtanding in need of his aſſiſtance, he was ſufficiently diſpleaſed at what had paſſed. In a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments after he had another Vexation given him. He was told, that it had been inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to carry the Princeſs away by force; that a part of <hi>Erabeus</hi> had been burnt; and that <hi>Democares</hi> had been wrongfully accuſed of having fired it. Theſe Stories renewed <hi>Gilipus</hi>'s Fears for <hi>Agiatis,</hi> and inclined him not to delay her Marriage any longer. He ſpoke of it to <hi>Agis,</hi> who was overjoyed at it, and cauſed it to be publiſhed the very ſame day, that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:103174:80"/>carry before his Palace, all their Bonds and other Writings they had to ſhew for money owing them. Though the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Citizens were already prepared for this loſs, yet they could not forbear being affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted at it. There was not one but <hi>Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Ageſiſtrate,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the leaſt joy for it. He had purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the faireſt Lands of <hi>Laconia,</hi> and had not yet paid for them: So that he perſwaded the King, his Nephew, ſpeedily to ſuppreſs all Debts, and at the ſame time, he adviſed him to defer the Partition of Eſtates. He repreſented to him, that he muſt not ruine, at once, the principal <hi>Spartans;</hi> and by theſe means he pretended to owe nothing, and to remain Maſter of all that he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed. <hi>Agis</hi> followed his firſt advice, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any trouble ariſing from it in <hi>Lacedemon.</hi> All the Citizens quietly obeyed him, and when they had burnt the Writings, and were returning melancholy home to their Houſes, Hiſtory obſerves, that <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſaid, in ſmiling, that he had never ſeen before ſo clear or ſo pleaſant a Fire.</p>

               <hi>Agiatis</hi> was not without ſorrow infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that they would no longer delay her Marriage; ſhe went a walking into the Park of <hi>Erabeus</hi> with <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> and as ſhe was uſed to diſcourſe with that Lady, with an entire

<q>Ah, <hi>Cyleſira, ſaid ſhe ſighing,</hi> they are at length, going to make me renounce my Liberty.

Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, Madam, <hi>replied</hi> Cyleſira, the Prince, who is appointed for you, is young, and handſome; his Merit is great, and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation high. I have obſerved all that you tell me, <hi>replied</hi> Agiatis, but I could never take any other Intereſt therein, than that of a Kinſwoman. Judge, <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> judge if I am any longer ſenſible of any thing that reſpects him, after my Journey to <hi>Corinth.</hi> That <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> of whom you have ſo often talked to me, <hi>replied</hi> Leriana's <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> muſt needs have ſomething very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary in him, ſince, quite unknown as he is, he carries away a place in your Heart, which you, in vain, endeavour to give a King who adores you. Let us not compare, I pray you <hi>inter rupted the Princeſs,</hi> the Sentiments of <hi>Agis,</hi> to the Tenderneſs of <hi>Themiſtides. Agis</hi> may have for me a diſcreet, and even ſolid Friendſhip. But <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> being more Ardent and more Active, was animated with a Paſſion
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103174:81"/>which I ſaw ſparking in his Eyes, and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in all his Behaviour. Ah! <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> haoſt thou ſeen him fighting for my. Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thou wouldſt agree with me, that there is nothing more terrible, nor more char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming than <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> when he has his Sword in his Hand. Yet this man ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, never appeared before me, but with Submiſſion. He was always ready to give me marks of his Complaiſance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. Alas! <hi>ſaid ſhe, in letting ſome Tears run down,</hi> how happy was I, when I bore thy Name. I ſaw <hi>Themiſtides</hi> every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I obſerved that he preferred an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> before a Beautiful Princeſs. I could not doubt but that he loved me ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly; and I had the pleaſure of loving him, without knowing it. For indeed, <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſira,</hi> I ſhould have been deprived of that ſweetneſs, if I had known the cauſe of it. That Joy is how paſt, without any hopes of return, and I have the misfortune, of not being able to change Conditions with thee, and to be the true <hi>Cyleſira.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>While the fair Princeſs is complaining af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, notice is brought her, that <hi>Gitipus</hi> is arrived at <hi>Erabeus.</hi> She wipes her Eyes, in ſpight of a new trouble ſhe feels, and turning towards <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> ſaies to her,
<q>This is the laſe time that I will talk unto
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103174:82"/>you of <hi>Themiſtides.</hi> Heaven, and my own Glory would have me chace him from my Heart, and I will do all my endeavours to think only on King <hi>Agis,</hi> for whom Prince <hi>Gilipus</hi> and Policy have deſigned me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She could not end theſe words without ſighing, and ſhe remained ſilent, until ſhe entred into the Court of the Caſtle. <hi>Gilipus</hi> alighted there from his Horſe, and as ſoon as he perceived that the Princeſs came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, as faſt as Decency gave her leave, he advanced towards her with open Arms. He embraced her tenderly, and his preſence moderating <hi>Agiatis</hi>'s ſadneſs, that Princeſs appeared with a Splendor, which <hi>Gilipus</hi> could not behold without tranſports of Joy. He then infinitely careſled <hi>Leoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> and <hi>Leriana;</hi> he enquired of them news of <hi>Aratus,</hi> And after ſome minutes repoſe, he deſired to know the principal Circumſtances of their Journey to <hi>Corinth,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Egina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agiatis</hi> immediately remembers every thing that happened to her. She conſiders, that ſhe has for ever forſaken that <hi>Themiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> to whom ſhe was ſo much obliged, and with whom ſhe was ſo ſmitten. That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection made her relapſe into her former me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy; and <hi>Gilipus</hi> having obſerved ſome
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:103174:82"/>change in her Countenance, ſaid to her,
<q>I perceive, Daugher, that you do not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vexation hear talk of <hi>Egina.</hi> The name of that Iſle renews your reſentment, and your diſpleaſures, in bringing to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance the attempts of <hi>Teleander</hi> and <hi>Leonidas.</hi> But comfort your ſelf, <hi>Agiatis, Lacedemon</hi> is at Peace; you are going to be Queen there; and, I believe, your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies may never more be in a Condition to come and give you any Affront. I think, <hi>added he ſmilingly,</hi> that you will there be yet leſs afraid of our Friends; and that you will no longer imagine, that <hi>Democares</hi> may have ſome deſign of offending you, when he ſhall give you his Praiſes. Sir, <hi>replied</hi> Agiatis <hi>bluſhing, Democares</hi> is more Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal than you imagine, and I could wiſh that he had not come to my Houſe, either oftner or more familiarly, than the other <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who are engaged in your Intereſts. How! <hi>replied</hi> Gilipus, do you believe that <hi>Democares,</hi> who is about to marry <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> and who ſees that you are going to be Queen, can have any Pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that may deſerve your Anger? Well then, Sir, <hi>replied</hi> Agiatis, let <hi>Democares</hi> marry <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> let him regard me as Prince <hi>Gilipus</hi>'s Daughter, and I will forget that he ever offended me. I am very glad to ſee
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103174:83"/>you in theſe Sentiments, <hi>replied</hi> Gilipus. There is nothing caſter, than to give you that ſatisfaction Sir, <hi>replied</hi> Leoſt henes, you will, perhaps, find a greater difficulty than you believe, in managing <hi>Democares</hi>'s Spirit. I perceive that he deceives my Siſter, and betrays you. He only coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits a love for <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> that he may be every moment near the Princeſs. In the meantime. I am willing to attend, until you have made him explain himſelf, as to what concerns my Niece; and if he uſes her no otherwiſe than I expect from his Humour, I ſhall let him know, that <hi>Cyleſira</hi>'s Alliance would have done him no Injury. It would mortally diſpleaſe me, <hi>replied</hi> Gili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, that you ſhould have any quarrel with <hi>Democares;</hi> but I cannot believe that he will give us any juſt cauſe to complain of him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>During the time that they are thus diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Democanes,</hi> that <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> is agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated with moſt ſevere Torments. Decency obliges him to aſſiſt at <hi>Agis</hi>'s Marriage, and he cannot reſolve, within himſelf, to be a looker on of that Prince's Happineſs. He loves <hi>Agiatis,</hi> and has lately offended her. <hi>Gilipus</hi> is to make him, in <hi>Cyleſira</hi>'s behalf, ſome Propoſitions, which he will not accept of and he does not knew after what manner
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103174:83"/>he ſhall excuſe himſelf, for breaking the promiſe he had given. In effect, he ſees no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vexation for him, if he ſtays at <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> while all the Diſcourſe there will be concerning Divertiſements. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pretends, that an important buſineſs calls him to <hi>Elis.</hi> He proteſts to King <hi>Agis,</hi> that he does not leave him in that Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, without a ſenſible diſpleaſure; and he departs, after having charged <hi>Amphares</hi> to diſabuſe <hi>Gilipus</hi> and <hi>Leriana,</hi> concerning <hi>Cyleſira</hi>'s Marriage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> and <hi>Amphares</hi> are choſen out to go to <hi>Erabeus,</hi> to fetch <hi>Agiatis. Gilipus</hi> receives them with an extraordinary Joy; but in a few moments after he is exceedingly diſquieted, when <hi>Amphares</hi> lets him know that <hi>Democares</hi> cannot marry <hi>Leriana</hi>'s Daughther. <hi>Gilipus</hi> reſents it highly, and expreſſes ſo much to <hi>Leriana</hi> and <hi>Leoſthenes;</hi> but withal, lets them ſee, that he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to diſſemble yet a while. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows on <hi>Cyleſira</hi> Jewels of a conſiderable value, and promiſes her greater advantages, than ſhe ſhould have found with <hi>Democares. Leoſthenes</hi> and <hi>Leriana</hi> are ſatisfied with his proceedings; but they never will pardon <hi>Democares;</hi> and <hi>Leriana</hi> cannot reſolve to bear <hi>Agiatis</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to <hi>Lacedemon.</hi> She is afraid of ſeeing every moment <hi>Democares,</hi> either at <hi>Agis</hi>'s
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:103174:84"/>or <hi>Gilipus</hi>'s. She apprehends yet more, leſt <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> ſhould have ſome difference with a Man, who was no leſs formidable for his cunning, than for his Courage. She diſcovers her Sentiments to <hi>Agiatis,</hi> and endeavours to get her approbation of them. <hi>Methinks,</hi> ſays ſhe to her, <hi>that no man will be ſurprized, if I withdraw. I have remitted you into the hands of Prince</hi> Gilipus. <hi>I ſee that you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longer need of my Advice, ſince you have no thing more to do, than to follow the Will of King</hi> Agis. The Princeſs hears her with Sorrow, and tells her that <hi>Democares</hi> is not at <hi>Lacedemon.</hi> Then looking on her with a melancholy Air, <hi>I intreat you,</hi> purſues ſhe, <hi>not to ſorſake me, when I have need of your aſſiſtance, and am leſs happy than you imagine. Madam,</hi> replied <hi>Leriana, I am willing to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you, but you ſhall give me leave, if you pleaſe, to depart from</hi> Lacedemon, <hi>before</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocares <hi>returns thither. Nothing would be more diſagreeable to me, than to hear</hi> Cyleſira<hi>'s Name, in thoſe reports that are uſually ſpread about, concerning Marriages, that are either likely to be, or have already failed. Beſides,</hi> Leoſthenes <hi>would be unwilling to leave me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind at</hi> Sparta, <hi>and if he remained there with me, I ſhould fear, leſt he ſhould fall into the Snares, which</hi> Democares <hi>would infallibly lay for him. Well then,</hi> replies <hi>Agiatis, I
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:103174:84"/>conſent to what you demand, provided that your abſence be not long, and that you return to</hi> Lacedemon, <hi>when King</hi> Agis <hi>will be gone to the Army.</hi> Democares <hi>without doubt will follow him, and we ſhall be delivered from the preſence of a Man, who ought to be no leſs odious to my ſelf, than you.</hi> In that moment <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> and <hi>Amphares</hi> enter her Chamber, and pray <hi>Agiatis</hi> to defer no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the happineſs of a Prince, who languiſht with an impatience to ſee her. The Princeſs dares not teſtifie with what reluctancy ſhe engaged her ſelf; and is contented to anſwer, that it belongs to Prince <hi>Gilipus,</hi> to diſpoſe of her deſtiny. They depart from <hi>Erabeus</hi> within an hour after, and as ſoon as they arrive on the bank of <hi>Euratas,</hi> they ſee very magnificent Tents, out of which <hi>Agis</hi> the King comes, encompaſſed with an infinite number of People. King <hi>Cleombro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> Husband to <hi>Cheloniſa,</hi> marched by his ſide, who being indebted to him for <hi>Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>'s Crown, which he had uſurped, left en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to him the Adminiſtration of all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. The Queens <hi>Archidamia</hi> and <hi>Ageſiſtrate,</hi> the Grandmother, and Mother of <hi>Agis, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomedon,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ageſilaus, Lyſander</hi> the <hi>Ephore,</hi> and ſeveral other very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Citizens, were in that Company. The whole Aſſembly were overjoyed at this Enterview, as they were afterwards at the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:103174:85"/>Alliance, which had been ſo ardently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by the Faction of the <hi>Agiades.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the Queen <hi>Agiatis</hi> appeared diſſatisfied, but they did attribute the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly they ſaw in her Eyes to Modeſty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> heard with an extraordinary joy that <hi>Agiatis</hi> was Married. He impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Thoughts upon it to <hi>Philiſtion. How glad am I,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that I am in a Condition to go and ſeek for</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>and that the King can no longer command me to eſpouſe a Princeſs, by whom he hoped for great advantages.</hi> Sir, replied <hi>Philiſtion</hi> to him, <hi>the King was not miſtaken in his Pretentions. Thoſe people, who are engaged in your Intereſts, ought to wiſh that you had not oppoſed his Deſigns, for the love of</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>whom he never will conſent that you ſhall Marry. I pray,</hi> Philiſtion, replied <hi>Cleomenes, inſtead of giving me vexation in ſo agreeable a Conjuncture, think of nothing but of returning to</hi> Lacedemon, <hi>to learn where we ſhall be able to ſee</hi> Cyleſira <hi>again.</hi> Sir, replied <hi>Philiſtion, after having diſcourſed unto you according to my Duty, I will obey your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders without any ſcruple, and I will go to</hi> Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta <hi>when it ſhall pleaſe you. Cleomenes</hi> would have had him gone on the morrow, but <hi>Philiſtion</hi> was obliged to ſtay near him until <hi>Xenares</hi> returned, who thought it expedient to go to <hi>Tegeam,</hi> to endeavour to make the Prince's Peace.</p>
            <pb n="171" facs="tcp:103174:85"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonidas</hi> was inflexible; he would never conſent to <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s return. <hi>But Sir, ſaid</hi> Xenares <hi>to him,</hi> Agiatis <hi>is Married; The Prince will never more diſobey you, and your ſeverity can bring no remedy—And 'tis,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted he roughly, <hi>becauſe the miſchief is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all cure, that I cannot pardon him.</hi> The Queens intreaties were not more powerful, and <hi>Xenares</hi> was conſtrained to return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obtaining any Grace. He was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> but <hi>Philiſtion</hi> began his Journey. He arrived at <hi>Lacedemon</hi> at the very time that <hi>Democanes</hi> was expected there, and within two days after, <hi>Leoſthenes, Lerians,</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> were departed from thence. <hi>Philiſtion</hi> viſited <hi>Democares,</hi> he was informed that the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> no longer thought of Marriage, and that <hi>Cyleſira</hi> was gone into <hi>Egina,</hi> with <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He gives an accompt of this to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and that Prince, after having heard him with a Joy not to be expreſſed, has no other thoughts than of going to an Iſle, where he hopes to find what is deareſt to him in the World. That he might be the more at liberty to make that journey, he told <hi>Xenares</hi> that he was weary of ſtaying at <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to ſee <hi>Leonidas</hi> once more, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prevall with him. <hi>I promiſe you,</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:103174:86"/>purſued he, <hi>to let you hear often from me, and you will pleaſe me infinitely, in writing to me an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what ſhall paſs at</hi> Tegeum. <hi>Xenares,</hi> who was not very deſirous that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> ſhould ſtay ſo near to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> conſented immediately to his Propoſal, and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted at that very inſtant. The Prince, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by <hi>Philiſtion</hi> and <hi>Erantor,</hi> marched di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly towards <hi>Mantinea,</hi> left <hi>Tegeum</hi> on the right hand, and continuing his way with all the diligence that Love and Hope could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, he ſoon arrived in a place which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired him with new tranſports of joy. He remembred how often he had ſeen <hi>Cyleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> there, he pleaſed himſelf with being juſt upon the point of ſeeing her again, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out takeing one Minutes repoſe, he went to her Houſe, whither he carried <hi>Philiſtion</hi> to entertain <hi>Leriana.</hi> But being informed that <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> was juſt gone out with his Siſter, he told <hi>Philiſtion</hi> that he would fain be alone, ſince <hi>Cyleſira</hi> was alone. <hi>If you enter,</hi> purſued he, <hi>Decency will oblige</hi> Cyleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra <hi>to ſpeak ſometimes to you, and you ſee, that all that ſhe ſhall ſay to you, will be loſt for</hi> Themiſtides.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philiſtion</hi> returns back, and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſcended, ſees the true <hi>Cyleſira</hi> whom he does not know. He is ſurpriſed at firſt, but afterwards recollecting himſelf, that ſhe
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103174:86"/>might be ſome friend of <hi>Cyleſira</hi>'s, he addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes himſelf to her, and ſays, <hi>Madam what pleaſure ſo ever there may be, in meeting ſo ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a Perſon as your ſelf, give me leave to confeſs, that it was</hi> Cyleſira <hi>I looked for. You have found her Sir,</hi> replied ſhe, <hi>I am called</hi> Cyleſira. <hi>But Madam,</hi> interrupted <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> very much moved, <hi>I have ſeen another</hi> Cyleſira <hi>in this very Chamber, and—Ah Sir, I underſtand you,</hi> interrupted ſhe in her turn, <hi>you ſpeak of a Perſon, who infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells me in all things. She is a fair Princeſs, who borrowed my name, and paſt for</hi> Leriana<hi>'s Daughter. The Civil Wars of</hi> Sparta <hi>drove her to</hi> Corinth, <hi>to lead there a more peaceable Life; in a word, Sir, 'Tis the Princeſs</hi> Agiatis <hi>whom you ſeek, and who at preſent is Queen of</hi> Lacedemon. At theſe words <hi>Cleomenes</hi> was ſtruck to the heart, as it were with a Mortal blow; his Eyes were troubled, and the Prince fell into a Swoon on a Couch that chanced to be near him. <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> all in a fright, calls up ſome people. They have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to <hi>Medicines,</hi> and as ſoon as the Prince begins to recover out of his Trance, he turns his languiſhing looks towards <hi>Cyleſira. What do you tell me, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her with a weak Voice? <hi>Alas! Sir,</hi> replies <hi>Cyleſira, I did not know you, when I gave you thoſe News; but your Meen, and this Accident do
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:103174:87"/>now ſufficiently inſtruct me that you are the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous</hi> Themiſtides, <hi>to whom the Princeſs</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giatis <hi>was in this Iſle obliged for her liberty. Yes, Madam,</hi> replies he with a Sigh, <hi>I am that unfortunate Wretch. By this time</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtion <hi>and</hi> Erantor <hi>came in, and the Prince returns back along with them, after he had asked</hi> Cyleſira <hi>pardon, for the diſorder he had occaſioned, by not being able to moderate his ſorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was hardly at home, when they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged him to go bed, but far from being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to take any repoſe there; he repaſſed in his mind, what there was odd and cruel in his Misfortunes. He complained of them to <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> after a manner able to move the moſt inſenſible Soul with pity. <hi>Confeſs,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>that Fate is very ingenious to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute me. It brings me to</hi> Gorinth <hi>in ſpite of the reſolution I had taken to make other Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages. It makes me deſperately in love with</hi> Agiatis, <hi>at a time when that Princeſs had changed her Name as well as I, and that our intereſt obliged as to conceal our true Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. There was a neceſſity of our being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to each other, to the end that there might be an obſtacle to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, to which I might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have inetended. But that is not all,</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtion, <hi>'tis this that caſt me into a deſpuit, out of which I ſhall never recover. When King</hi>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:103174:87"/>Leonidas <hi>does enterpriſe to get for me a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Felicity. I muſt my ſelf oppoſe my own good Fortune; I muſt fight to give</hi> Agiatis <hi>to my Rival. I muſt enrage a Father, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours only for my Happineſs, in a word, I muſt render my ſelf the moſt unhappy of all men. But I ſhall not be ſo long; viſit</hi> Cyleſira <hi>from me, intreat her to tell the Queen, that the News of her Marriage has given me my Death; and that</hi> Themiſtides, <hi>who has conſtantly ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her, ever ſince the fatal Minute wherein he ſaw her near</hi> Timoleon's <hi>Garden, could live no longer, when once he knew he could not live for her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He afterwards conſidered whether he ſhould not bid him tell her that he was <hi>Gleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes;</hi> but at length he thought it beſt to paſs ſtill for <hi>Themiſtides.</hi> He believed that he ſhould be hated, if he were known to be a Prince's Son, whom the <hi>Agiades</hi> regarded as their Enemy, and againſt whom <hi>Agiat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l</hi> might poſſibly preſerve a particular Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beſides he was perſwaded that if he met with ſome occaſion, to ſee the Queen again at <hi>Lacedemon, Cleomenes</hi> would not be as ſoon permitted, as <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> to approach that Princeſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> who expected not a benefit from <hi>Cyleſira</hi> than from the <hi>Phiſitians,</hi> returned to her Houſe, and found her ſo moved with
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:103174:88"/>the accident that had lately happened, that he himſelf was touched with a ſtronger In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination for that amiable Creature, than he would have believed. <hi>I do not doubt, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>but that</hi> Themiſtides <hi>would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a great deal of comfort, if he ſaw that you took part in his Sufferings. I can better aſſure you,</hi> replied ſhe, <hi>that</hi> Themiſtides <hi>would find much eaſe in his Calamity, if he knew that</hi> Agiatis <hi>would be ſenſible thereof as ſoon as I ſhall have given her the News. I think that even without diſpleaſing that Beautiful Princeſs, I may entruſt you with that part of her Secrets, that may contribute to the preſervation of that</hi> Themiſtides <hi>to whom ſhe is ſo much engaged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyleſira</hi> then related what obliging Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>Agiatis</hi> had for <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> but ſhe did not think it convenient to ſay any thing of her Tenderneſs. <hi>Philiſtion</hi> could not thank her enough, and as he beheld her, he accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in himſelf <hi>Democares</hi> both of Injuſtice and Blindneſs. He returned home, and gave <hi>Cleomenes</hi> an account of all the circumſtances that could moderate his Deſpair. And the Prince had no ſooner underſtood that he was beloved, but he eſteemed himſelf the more unhappy, for having loſt a greater good than he imagined. He was unwilling to complain of it to <hi>Philiſtion;</hi> but in that moment <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſthenes,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:103174:88"/>Leriana,</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> came to viſit him. They being ignorant that <hi>Themiſtides</hi> was <hi>Cleamenes,</hi> Leriana <hi>ſaid to him, Methinks rather than be afflicted for</hi> Agiatis<hi>'s Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you ought to rejoyce that the</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>whom you have delivered out of</hi> Teleanders <hi>hands, is now in a Condition to give you the reward that is due to you. Whilſt ſhe paſt for my Daughter ſhe durſt offer you nothing for the Service you have rendred her. She knew that ſhe could make you no Preſent, but what was either below the merit of</hi> Themiſtides, <hi>or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Condition of</hi> Cyleſira. <hi>You know, Madam,</hi> replied the Prince, <hi>that you have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and above paid that Service: Oh! that I could but purchoſe the ſame acknowledgment with the loſs of my life; but I dare not promiſe to my ſelf ſo much happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſpoke with ſo much Vehemence, that <hi>Leriana</hi> was afraid a longer Converſation might provedangerous to him. She deſired to be gone, nevertheleſs ſhe endeavoured firſt to appeaſe <hi>Themiſtides</hi>'s diſquiets. <hi>I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that the Queen would be moſt ſenſibly diſpleaſed, if ſhe knew that you aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned your ſelf to deſpair. She eſteems you, ſhe has a real Friendſhip for you, and if you conſult your reaſon, I do not ſee, but that you have greater cauſe to reſt ſatisfied than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.

               <hi>prefer</hi> Themiſtides <hi>before the King of</hi> Lacedemon, <hi>and though you were of a Rank capable of Eſpouſing her, was not the engagement</hi> Gilipus <hi>lay under a bar to your pretentions? Give me leave to add,</hi> replied <hi>Leoſthenes, that you ought not to let fall a Courage, of which we ſhall in a few days ſtand in need. 'Tis believed that</hi> Agis <hi>will ſuddenly come to joyn</hi> Aratus, <hi>and if you hate your Life, had you not better end it with Glory againſt an Army of Enemies, than loſe it obſcurely in this Iſle? Beſides, do you think that</hi> Agiatis <hi>ought to retain any ſenſe of gratitude for you, if you dye with Grief for hearing that ſhe is Queen of</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon? <hi>That adorable Princeſs,</hi> replied <hi>Cleomenes</hi> with a ſigh, <hi>will one day per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps know, that my deſpair is better groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded than you imagine. But ſince you aſſure me, that we are likely to have occaſions, wherein I ſhall be able to finiſh my Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, I conſent to prolong my unfortunate days to the time for which you make me hope. In the mean time,</hi> purſued he, turning towards <hi>Leriana, I intreat you to let me hear ſome News from the Queen, when you ſhall receive any. Be well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that the indifference I have for all things, cannot make me renounce that Curioſity.</hi>

               <hi>Leriana</hi> granted him his Requeſt, and in a few days after they went together to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> They found there a very troubleſome Diviſion, which a new engagement of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leanders</hi> had lately occaſioned. That Prince came to viſit <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> as ſoon as he knew he was arrived; and after having given him ſome marks of a moſt ſincere Friendſhip, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>a Charming Perſon of this City has made me farget the Queen of</hi> Sparta. <hi>How ardent ſoever I am in my Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I cannot keep them, when once I ſee 'tis impoſſible to ſatisfie them; and I think I have found, at laſt, what ought to make me very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. You ſhall now ſee me more juſt to the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious</hi> Cleomenes; <hi>and I will, with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, regard a Merit, which Jealouſie hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rendred unſupportable to me. I rejoice, Sir,</hi> replied the Prince of <hi>Lacedemon, to hear of the change which you eſteem ſo agreeable, and which ſuffers me to pretend to your Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. But to ſpeak ingenuouſly unto you, I do not conceive, that a Man can give over loving the admirable</hi> Cyleſira. <hi>I confeſs,</hi> replied <hi>Teleander, that I ſhould have found a great deal of difficulty to break my Chains; without the aſſiſtance of ſome Circumſtances, which I found very moving, and of which I will, if you pleaſe, give you an account. You know whether Lovers care for being ſilent upon ſuch
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103174:90"/>Subjects, and beſides I ought to let the Prince</hi> Cleomenes <hi>ſee, that I am no longer his Rival.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Teleander</hi> obſerved that <hi>Themiſtides</hi> was diſpoſed to hear him, and began his relation in theſe Terms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You ſhall know that</hi> Gerontilas <hi>an intimate Friend of</hi> Aratus<hi>'s, and the Principal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate of this City, has a daughter of about fifteen years of age, whom I ſhould call a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, if I did not ſpeak to a Prince who is quite filled with the Idea of</hi> Agiatis, <hi>About a year ſince that Fair Creature loſt her Mother, and went to live in</hi> Arcadia <hi>with a Siſter of</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontilas, <hi>from whom ſhe expected a confiderable Eſtate. All the young People of Quality there, who could pretend to</hi> Epidelia, <hi>(that is her Name) ſighed for her, did aſſiduouſly viſit</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontilas, <hi>and put him into a very great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity of whom he ſhould make choice. At length the Father came to a Reſolution, about the time we returned from</hi> Egina. <hi>He promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Daughter to a young</hi> Corinthian, <hi>named</hi> Zaleton, <hi>who was behind none of his Rivals either for Birth and Riches. When they would bring</hi> Epidelia <hi>back hither, her Aunt died, and the Princeſs of</hi> Erymanthus <hi>demanded that fair Creature, in order to have the ſame care of her as of</hi> Ariamite, <hi>until the accompliſhment of her Marriage.</hi> Gerontilas <hi>thanked</hi> Onecryſa,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103174:90"/>
               <hi>gave her</hi> Epidelia <hi>with Pleaſure, and that charming Lady arrived in our Houſe, the ſame day as you departed out of this Town. Her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brought her in the Evening to</hi> Onecryſa<hi>'s, and as I returned from a walk, wherein I had been a meditating by what means I might ſee</hi> Agiatis <hi>again, I was ſurprized to find a great Company in</hi> Onecryſa<hi>'s Chamber: But I was much more, when amongſt ſo many People, I had ſingled out</hi> Epidelia<hi>'s Face. It may be ſaid that there was ſomething in it that dazled my Eyes.</hi> Epidelia <hi>is young and fair, her Eyes are blew and perfectly beautiful, her Shope is eaſie, and her Complexion admirable. I fixt my Eyes upon her, and approached her.</hi> Ariami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te <hi>preſented me to her, and addreſſing her Speech to me, ſaid, You ſee, Brother, that after</hi> Cyleſira's <hi>departure, Fate has brought us ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lady, as charming as ſhe, to repair the loſs we have ſuffered. Inſtead of making any anſwer, I moſt reſpectfully ſaluted</hi> Epidelia. <hi>I told her that there was ſome injuſtice, that</hi> Zaleton <hi>ſhould be ſo ſoon happy, and I added that I knew ſome who would pay dearer for the good Fortune he was likely to have, Sir,</hi> anſwered ſhe with a Smile, <hi>that which you call good Fortune is ſo little</hi> ſo, <hi>that</hi> Geronti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las <hi>was unwilling they ſhould wait too long for it. Poſſibly he apprehends they might be weary of demanding it. Do not you take notice, ſaid</hi>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:103174:91"/>Ariamite <hi>to me, that the Perſons moſt capable of engaging you are engaged themſelves, before you know them. I perceive it but too plainly,</hi> replied I, <hi>and as I was going on,</hi> Gerontilas <hi>and</hi> Zatelon <hi>drew near, and the Converſation changed. Though I felt not my heart as yet touched, yet I could not forbear to look on</hi> Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telon <hi>with deſpight, and perhaps he did not retire over-well ſatisfied with a man, who took no great pains to conſtrain himſelf. That night I dreamt a little leſs than uſual of</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>and on the morrow moved with a preſent good, I went to</hi> Epidelia's <hi>Chamber, having heard that my Siſter was gone in. I found that fair Lady in a little diſorder, with which I was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Her Neck was bare enough, and as ſhe would have taken a Veil to cover it, I hindred her with a Liberty which</hi> Ariamite <hi>could make her pardon, and which my Age and Humour rendred in a manner excuſable.</hi> Epidelia <hi>bluſht, and appeared a thouſand times handſomer than before, ſo that finding my ſelf all on Fire, and not being able to moderate my Tranſports: O! Heaven! cryed I out, muſt all theſe Treaſures be appointed to compleat the Happineſs of</hi> Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telon? <hi>I had hardly ended theſe words, when I ſaw</hi> Gerontilas <hi>enter, I apprehended he would take it ill that I ſhould be in his Daughters Chamber in a morning; but inſtead of appearing ſurprized at it, he lookt upon me as a priviledged
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103174:91"/>Friend. Methinks,</hi> ſaid he to me, <hi>that you ſpoke of</hi> Zatelon. <hi>I did indeed,</hi> anſwered I with trouble enough, <hi>and I ſaid that you were going to make him the happieſt man in the World. We ought not to hear this flattery,</hi> replied he ſmilingly, <hi>from the Prince of</hi> Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthus. <hi>I aſſure you,</hi> interrupted I, <hi>that I never ſaid any thing I thought more really, and I would to Heaven, I were allowed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the charming</hi> Epidelia <hi>with the fortunate</hi> Zatelon. <hi>If you ſpeak according to your real Sentiments,</hi> replied <hi>Gerontilas</hi> with a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Air, <hi>I anſwer you that</hi> Zatelon <hi>ſhall not diſpute her with you. I confeſs that I am as it were engaged, but I will make no Scruple to break my word for my Daughters advantage. I was tranſported with joy to hear ſo favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an anſwer, and having obſerved that</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delia <hi>ſeemed ſatisfied with it, I went to ſpeak to</hi> Aratus <hi>and</hi> Onecryſa. <hi>I obtained the conſent I deſired from them, and I can ſay that from that time I have led a life pleaſant enough, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Ardour of my Temper, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets that are inſeparable from it. Not but that my good Fortune has been deferred.</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontilas <hi>was forced to create ſome difficulties in</hi> Zatelon's <hi>Marriage, and when it was in order to give me</hi> Epidelia, <hi>my Rivals Kindred exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted complaints, that</hi> Gerontilas <hi>broke his Faith with them, in order to prefer a Strangers Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:103174:92"/>before theirs. One part of the People de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for them, and we ſtayed to appeaſe that Commotion, inſtead of augmenting it by marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Epidelia. <hi>In the mean time that aimable Lady is continually at</hi> Onecryſa<hi>'s. I have eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment the Pleaſure of ſeeing and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, and I would be glad that you ſhould ſee the cauſe of my change. For your part, Sir, I obſerve in your Eyes a kind of Melancholy, that tells me you have too much conſtancy. I fear leſt you ſhould alwayes love the Queen of</hi> Lacedemon, <hi>and thereby be alwayes unhappy. But believe me, accommodate your ſelf a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le to my humour, and let us go and endeavour to divers our ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> would have thanked <hi>Teleander</hi> for his relation, but he had no time. The Prince of <hi>Erymanthus,</hi> who was haſty in all his ways, took him by the hand, and carried him to the Princeſs <hi>Onecryſa's. Themiſtides</hi> was received there with all the joy they were capable of expreſſing to him. <hi>Ariami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> could not behold him without tenderneſs, and <hi>Epidelia</hi> told him ſhe would be obliged to <hi>Teleander</hi> for the Favour he did her.
<q>Sir, <hi>continued ſhe,</hi> I confeſs, I had a great deſire to know the Prince <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> I never ſaw him but in a Picture; but the Princeſs <hi>Ariamite</hi> has told me things of him, which Pictures cannot repreſent.</q> 
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> ſaw
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103174:92"/>himſelf obliged to anſwer with acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<q>I queſtion not, Madam, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> but that you find me very different from the <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> which the Princeſs <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amite</hi> has painted to you; but if I owe her any thanks for thoſe ſtroaks with which ſhe has been pleaſed to honour me, I dare ſay you have the ſame obligation for Prince <hi>Teleander.</hi> But inſtead of exceeding the Truth, in ſpeaking of you, he could expreſs but half the Charms which render you admired.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He ſtill conſtrained himſelf for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and as he wiſh'd to go to <hi>Aratus,</hi> that Great Man came to ſee him at <hi>Onecryſa</hi>'s. They talked at firſt of the Queen <hi>Agiatis,</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> afterwards ſaid, that <hi>Agis</hi> would already have departed from <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> if he had not deſired to aſſiſt at the Creation of the <hi>Epho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi>
               <q>I think, <hi>continued he,</hi> you have no great Pleaſure to hear theſe Magiſtrates ſpoke of. You have but too well experienced that they take upon them an Authority more abſolute than that of their Kings, whom they force to give them an account of the Government, and even of their own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I know, replied <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> that the Kings of <hi>Sparta</hi> have alwayes conducted their Armies in Perſon, and that the <hi>Ephores</hi> have gained the Peoples favour in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103174:93"/>but I have wondred a thouſand times that ſome vigorous Prince returning to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon</hi> at the head of his Troops, had not freed themſelves from the Tyranny of thoſe Magiſtrates. So great a Change, <hi>replied</hi> Aratus <hi>to him,</hi> was reſerved for Prince <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omenes,</hi> and I do not doubt but he may one day pull down the Power of the <hi>Ephores,</hi> to raiſe up that of the Kings, and to make it Independent.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In that very Minute, <hi>Aratus</hi> was adviſed, that the <hi>Etolians</hi> were preparing to paſs the Strait, to enter into <hi>Peloponeſus,</hi> and that a reinforcement of the <hi>Athamans</hi> had joyn'd them on the Banks of the River <hi>Evena.</hi> The General of the <hi>Achaians</hi> received not thoſe News without vexation. He percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the Factions, which were formed at <hi>Corinth,</hi> deprived him of a great aſſiſtance; and beſides, he knew that the Troops which he had cauſed to be raiſed in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> were not yet in a condition to March. He would nevertheleſs advance towards the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with the Body of an Army, and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Gerontilas</hi> what order was to be kept in <hi>Corinth</hi> during his abſence. <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> proffered his Service to <hi>Aratus,</hi> that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral gave him the Command of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, and <hi>Teleander,</hi> who would alſo depart in ſpight of his Love, obtained the like Employment.</p>
            <pb n="187" facs="tcp:103174:93"/>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> who hated life enough to deſire an end to it in this occaſion, that was about to preſent it ſelf, was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to expoſe <hi>Philiſtion</hi> to the ſame danger, and inſtead of deſiring to carry him along with him, he ſtudied nothing more than how to get Preferment for him from <hi>Leoniàas.</hi> He did alſo intreat him to return to <hi>Sparta.</hi>
               <q>If I dye, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> you ſhall ſee the Queen <hi>Agiatis,</hi> and you ſhall make her a faithful Relation of all that has happened to me. If on the contrary I am deſtined ſtill to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, you ſhall contrive ſome expedient to make me ſee again that adorable Princeſs. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtion</hi> threw himſelf at <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Feet, and proteſted that he would not forſake him. Sir, <hi>purſued he,</hi> let <hi>Leriana</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do you that Office, when they return to <hi>Sparta;</hi> while I for my part, will not be altogether unuſeful to you in the Army.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> conſented to what <hi>Philiſtion</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he gave <hi>Erantor</hi> Order to make all things ready for his departure, and then he goes to <hi>Leoſthenes. Leriana</hi> told him ſhe had juſt then received a Letter from <hi>Agiatis.</hi>
               <q>I aſſure you, <hi>continued ſhe,</hi> that Princeſs is not happy. She regards <hi>Amphares</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocares</hi> as the Kings Enemies and her own; and yet ſhe has had the diſpleaſure to ſee
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103174:94"/>
                  <hi>Agis</hi> employing all his Credit, to make <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phares</hi> Principal <hi>Ephore</hi> of <hi>Lacedemon.</hi> She is alſo going to retire to the Palace of the Queens <hi>Archimadia</hi> and <hi>Ageſiſtrate</hi> with an intention to ſee no body during the Kings abſence; ſo that ſhe intreats me to take once more a journey to <hi>Sparta</hi> to comfort her during that time. I am not diſpoſed to it without ſome ſtrange agitation, and yet what reflection ſoever I make, I cannot foreſee what it is either to fear or hope.</q> 
               <hi>May I flatter my ſelf ſo much, replied</hi> Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <hi>as to believe that you will not quite forget me, and that you will ſay ſomething of</hi> Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides, <hi>if you have an opportunity to do it? I ſhould not dare, replied</hi> Leriana. <hi>There are two men whom the Queen will not hear named,</hi> Democares <hi>whom ſhe hates, and</hi> Themiſtides <hi>whom ſhe fears. Poſſibly I tell you too much, but 'tis better not to keep ſecret from you what concerns her repoſe and your own. The Queen has ſuch Sentiments for you as you have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain of them; and methinks Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude requires that you ſhould not any way en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to diſturb the Tranquillity of her Heart. Alas!</hi> replied <hi>Cleomenes</hi> with a ſigh, <hi>if her Heart enjoyes Tranquillity, 'tis neither favourable to</hi> Themiſtides, <hi>nor ſenſible of his Misfortunes.</hi> That Converſation was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with an Air melancholy enough,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103174:94"/>while <hi>Philiſtion</hi> entertained <hi>Cyleſira</hi> with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Sentiments of joy, which ſeemed new to him.</p>
            <p>On the Morrow, <hi>Aratus, Cleomenes,</hi> and <hi>Teleander</hi> departed for the Camp. and they hardly were arrived there, when they were informed that a Party of the <hi>Etolians</hi> were come as far as <hi>Helice.</hi> The two young Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deſired to go and drive them back, and having obtained permiſſion for it, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted under the Conduct of a General Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, whoſe experience was known to <hi>Aratus.</hi> They marcht along the Boſome of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and as the Enemies were puſſt up with Pride for their Succeſs, and advanced continually, the <hi>Achaians</hi> met them near <hi>Cerynchus,</hi> and charged them vigorouſly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> whoſe great Courage was aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the Averſion he had for Life, pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in with Impetuoſity on the firſt Ranks, and broke them. He mingled with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with a fearleſneſs which amazed them, and having perceived the Chief, he with his Sword opened a way to come at him. The <hi>Etolian</hi> for his part provoked with ſo noble an Ardour, advanced towards that formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enemy. They joined and began a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat that animated both their Parties to redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their endeavours. <hi>Teleander</hi> who loved Glory, and found himſelf warmed with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103174:95"/>ſeconded <hi>Cleomenes</hi> with ſo much Valour, that the <hi>Etolians</hi> were beaten and put to flight. <hi>Teleander</hi> made himſelf Maſter of their Standard. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> wounded, and took their Commander Priſoner, and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaians</hi> General Officer, and <hi>Philiſtion</hi> did alſo ſignalize themſelves by their Actions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aratus</hi> received the Conquerors with a great deal of joy, and that joy was yet aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, when he underſtood that they had no Wounds but what were very ſlight. He praiſed <hi>Themiſtides</hi> aloud; He careſſed <hi>Telean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and having been informed that <hi>Clome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>'s Priſoner was <hi>Eurilaus</hi> Prince of <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactum,</hi> Son to the General of the <hi>Etolians,</hi> he took all the care of him that was due to a Perſon of his Rank and Merit. In a few days after <hi>Onecryſa</hi> came to the Camp, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice with <hi>Aratus</hi> for his fortunate Succeſs. She brought along with her <hi>Ariamite, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delia,</hi> and ſeveral Ladies of Quality; ſo that there was in the <hi>Achaian</hi> Army almoſt the ſame Pleaſures as at <hi>Corinth. Aratus</hi> preſented <hi>Eurilaus</hi> to <hi>Onecryſa,</hi> and 'twas ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the <hi>Etolian</hi> Prince fixt his Eyes with ſome ſurprize on <hi>Ariamite</hi>'s Viſage. 'Twas afterwards ſaid, that the young War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour was <hi>Themiſtides</hi>'s Priſoner. <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> then addreſſing himſelf to the General of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:103174:95"/>the <hi>Achaians, ſaid, Sir, will you be pleaſed, that I reſign to a Fair Princeſs the right you give me in the Prince of</hi> Naupactum. <hi>She would ſoon overcome him, and with leſs difficulty than we have done. 'Tis your part, Madam,</hi> added he, <hi>turning himſelf towards</hi> Ariamite, <hi>to put the Valiant</hi> Eurilaus <hi>in Chains, and to diſarm all the</hi> Etolians <hi>by that Victory. You know, Madam,</hi> perſued the <hi>Eto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Prince, <hi>that I am in no very fit Condition to make pretentions, which a better Fortune would not perhaps permit.</hi> In pronouncing theſe words, he beheld <hi>Ariamite</hi> with an air con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing enough, that he followed his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours intentions. <hi>Ariamite,</hi> who for her part had with ſome deſpite heard <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Declaration, fail'd not to feel ſome ſecret Pleaſure, in conſidering that <hi>Eurilaus</hi> was handſome, and had appeared ſurprized, and concerned in ſpeaking to her.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Etolians</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring a great reinforcement to repair the loſs they had ſuffered. <hi>Eurilaus</hi> does not hear thoſe News without Sorrow. He cannot leave <hi>Ariamite,</hi> and refuſes to return into <hi>Etolia</hi> upon his <hi>Parole,</hi> when <hi>Aratus</hi> proffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him leave ſo to do. He writes to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the <hi>Etolians,</hi> that there never was a Generoſity like <hi>Aratus</hi>'s; and he lets <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> know, that he wiſhed with all his Heart
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:103174:96"/>he could render himſelf worthy of his Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. <hi>Aratus</hi> hears him with Pleaſure, ſends him back to the General of the <hi>Etolians,</hi> to he informed of his Will; and promiſes to make no attempt until he knew the ſucceſs of his Negotiation.</p>
            <p>About that time the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> arrived, every body thronged about them to admire their Order and Diſcipline. <hi>Agis</hi> appeared at their Head, in the ſame Habit as the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers he lead. He was diſtinguiſht only by a more noble Air, and by a greater impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſignalize himſelf. <hi>Aratus</hi> went to meet that Prince, he treated him with the deference due to his Rank, and ſhew him a commodious Place, which he had choſen out for the Encampment of his Troops, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis</hi> replied to him, <hi>Sir, ſince I am young, and come only to the aſſiſtance of the</hi> Achaians, <hi>'tis among them that I intend to lodge, and 'tis their Famous General I will obey. Sir,</hi> replied <hi>Aratus, we know that Kings are in the World only to Command, and we ſhould dread ſome ill Succeſs, if the Illuſtrious</hi> Agis <hi>reverſed an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo Sacred, and ſo general.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> could not without a double ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Sorrow ſee himſelf in the ſame Camp with a happy Rival, who enjoys <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſira.</hi> His firſt Tranſports would have him go and attack <hi>Agis</hi> at the head of his Troops,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:103174:96"/>and ſacrifice him to his Jealouſie, and the intereſts of <hi>Leonidas.</hi> He eſteems that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking eaſie enough for an unhappy wretch who renounces his Life; but when the motions of his deſpair permit him to make ſome reflexion on his Love and Generoſity, he ſoon changes that thought. He regards ſuch a deſign as Criminal, ſince he cannot execute it otherwiſe than by ſurpriſe. He frets when he conſiders what affliction he ſhould give <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> and thinks on the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred ſhe would conceive for the Murderer of <hi>Agis.</hi> Beſides, he had been informed how that Prince had been unwilling to conſent to lay an Ambuſcade for <hi>Leonidas</hi> upon the way of <hi>Tege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> when <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> and <hi>Lyſander</hi> had conſpired his ruine. So that inſtead of fixing on his firſt reſolution, he choſe to wait for an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to fight like a Kings Son, rather than periſh like a private adventurer.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> deſire nothing more than to ſignalize themſelves, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaians</hi> expect with indifferency enough what will be <hi>Aratus</hi>'s Reſolution. They are ſurprized to ſee that the General without any more ado reſolves not to fight. He deſires not to give a deciſive Battle, and to end the War ſo ſoon. The <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> are amazed at that Conduct, and perhaps without any great reaſon. <hi>Aratus</hi> would have loſt his Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:103174:97"/>and his Credit, by the defeat of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and by a Victory, he would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained the <hi>Etolians</hi> to demand Peace, and himſelf would have been obliged to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw without any Authority. He therefore repreſents to the King of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> that he had better keep the Enemy in a continual Alarm, than to hazard a Battel, the loſs of which might draw after it that of all <hi>Pelopone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> He continued ſo firm in his opinion, that it could not be comprehended why he had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred uſeleſs an inforcement he had ſo long expected. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> returned home, and were angry at it; but as ſoon as they were departed, the Marriage of <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> and <hi>Ariamite</hi> were openly diſcourſed of. That Princeſs was very much concerned for it, which ſhe teſtified to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and gave him many other marks of her Tenderneſs. <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>is it poſſible that you are not concerned for a Perſon, that would, but cannot be yours? My Misfortune will have it ſo,</hi> replied he in ſighing, <hi>and the only comfort I have, is that I contributed to a Prince's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, who is not altogether unworthy of you: Heaven knows that I have for you all thoſe Sentiments of Gratitude, that I ought, and that I might have ſome means of expreſſing them, has given me the advantages over the Prince of</hi> Naupactum. <hi>I pray, Madam, give way to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:103174:97"/>his happineſs. You ſee that deſtiny ordaines it by the Events it hath permitted. It would have you be happy with</hi> Eurilaus, <hi>and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Cleomenes <hi>to his ill Fortune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince urged this ſo forcibly, and with ſo many marks of a real Amity, that <hi>Ariamite</hi> came at length to hear him without any reluctancy. <hi>Teleander</hi> and <hi>Epidelia</hi> then drew near, and made them change the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. <hi>Eurilaus</hi> arrived in the Evening, and had procured a Truce for three Months between the <hi>Achaians</hi> and the <hi>Etolians.</hi> So that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> thought of going to ſearch for Wars elſewhere, as ſoon as he ſhould recover his Health, if the intereſts of <hi>Leonidas</hi> would not recal him to <hi>Lacedemon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While he is gathering ſtrength, <hi>Agis</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into <hi>Sparta,</hi> and the Troops he led back, ſeconded by the People, demand of him the Partition he had promiſed. On the other ſide the Principal <hi>Spartans</hi> oppoſe it. They aſſemble themſelves together, and prepare to make a laſt Effort. <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to loſe thoſe fair Lands he poſſeſſes, goes to the King his Nephew. <hi>Sir,</hi> ſays he to him, <hi>this is a nice Conjuncture; Our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies are more terrible than you imagine, they have in their Country-Houſes an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of People, from whom they may receive a ſpeedy aſſiſtance. So that you had better defer
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:103174:98"/>a while the Execution of your deſign. Stay to ſurprize them when they are tired out with ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on their Guards. You ſhall then do what you pleaſe with their Eſtates and Perſons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out arming our Citizens the one againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Agis</hi> weighs what Reſolution he ought to take; and <hi>Democares,</hi> whoſe Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie is by ſo much the more violent, in that it is ſhut up in his own heart, takes this opportunity to ruine a Prince, whoſe Preſence is become unſupportable to him. He talks in private with the moſt Mutinous of the People. He ſeems to pity them, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving followed the Faction of a weak Man, who dares not give them the recompence he has promiſed them. Then he cauſes notice to be given to <hi>Leonidas</hi>'s Faction, that the People are enraged, and that it might make uſe of ſo favourable an opportunity to recal <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Father. The Great Men follow <hi>Democares</hi>'s Counſel, and ſend their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to <hi>Tegeum. Leonidas</hi> returns with ſome Troops, and is received as it were in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph by his Friends. The People are in a Conſternation. <hi>Agis</hi> runs for Sanctuary to the Temple of <hi>Juno,</hi> and <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> ſeeks his ſafety in the Temple of <hi>Neptune. Cheloniſa,</hi> who would not leave her Father in his Miſery, does not forſake her Husband in his Misfortune, ſhe runs to <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> to comfort him and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:103174:98"/>ſerve him. She begs his Life of <hi>Leonidas</hi> ſo earneſtly, and with ſo much preſſing, that at length ſhe obtains it, and follows <hi>Cleombro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> to <hi>Megalopolis</hi> whither he retires. <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medon,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> charmed with <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſa</hi>'s Generoſity, cries out, as Hiſtory, has obſerved, <hi>Ah</hi> Cleombrotus, <hi>thou gaineſt more in recovering</hi> Cheloniſa, <hi>than thou loſeſt in quitting the Crown of</hi> Sparta.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Creteſilea</hi> and <hi>Xenares</hi> teſtifie to <hi>Leonidas</hi> the Joy they have to ſee him re-eſtabliſht with more Authority than before. <hi>Sir,</hi> adds the Queen, <hi>for Heavens ſake, render our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction compleat, and give your conſent that we may recal</hi> Cleomenes. <hi>I dare aſſure your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> purſues <hi>Xenares, that nothing can confirm your Power better than the Preſence of the Prince. Shew the Common-wealth, that the Royal Power is not likely to leave your Houſe, ſhould even the Gods call you to themſelves, Shew the</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>a Prince, ſo worthy to command them after you. Leonidas</hi> ſeems to grant to their intreaties only a return, which his own tenderneſs already exacted from him; and <hi>Xenares,</hi> without loſing one moments time, writes to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> gives him an account of every thing that paſt, and conjures him to come back.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Archidamia, Ageſiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Agiatis,</hi> run to the ſame Sanctuary
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:103174:99"/>as <hi>Agis,</hi> and could not behold that Prince without giving ſome Tears to his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. <hi>Agis</hi> is encompaſſed about with <hi>Gilipus, Amphares, Democares,</hi> and <hi>Arceci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus.</hi> His Meen appeared ſo little altered by his diſgrace, that he received the Queens with the ſame Countenance he was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to do. He endeavours to comfort them, he repreſents to them the Caprices of Fortune, and conjures them to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible neither of her Injuries or Favours. Then continuing his diſcourſe with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Gravity that was uſual to him, he ſaid, <hi>you ſaw</hi> Agis <hi>yeſterday on a Throne, and to day You ſee him fled for Refuge to a Temple. Teſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> Lacedemon <hi>ſtill beheld</hi> Leonidas <hi>as a baniſhed Man, to day ſhe receives him with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, and acknowledges him her King. Theſe Revolutions, and the Courage of theſe Generous Friends whom you ſee about me, may ſtill terrifie our Enemies, and raiſe our hopes. But, Madam,</hi> added he, <hi>addreſſing himſelf to the fair Princeſs with whom he was charmed, I confeſs I have no longer any Conſtancy, when I behold your Affliction. It has ſo penetrated me, that as long as I ſhall ſee the Marks of it in your beautiful Eyes, I ſhall employ all my cares only to moderate your ſorrow, inſtead of thinking on my re-eſtabliſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agiatis</hi> conſtrained her ſelf immediately,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:103174:99"/>and appeared leſs melancholy. <hi>Agis, Gilipus, Archidamia,</hi> and <hi>Ageſiſtrate,</hi> obſerved the Effort ſhe made, and while they admired ſo ready a deference, <hi>Democares</hi> was moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly vext at it. He ſtudied how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <hi>Agis,</hi> and render himſelf Maſter of <hi>Agiatis</hi>'s deſtiny. Nevertheleſs he ſaw, that he could not diſpoſe of the remaining Faction of the <hi>Agiades,</hi> but by the abſence of <hi>Gilipus.</hi> He therefore, with a ſeeming zeal to the Party, ſaid to <hi>Agis, Sir, methinks that Prince</hi> Gilipus <hi>is not ſafe in this Town, and that he ought to ſecure himſelf at</hi> Erabeus. <hi>By that precaution he would evade the fury of our Enemies, he would joyn with King</hi> Cleom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotus, <hi>and, keeping</hi> Leonidas <hi>in a continual alarm, he would prevent him from making any new attempts againſt your Majeſty. Agis</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of <hi>Democares</hi>'s Opinion, but <hi>Gilipus,</hi> oppoſed it, and proteſted that he would not leave the King. He muſt however depart. <hi>Democares</hi>'s opinion was followed, and <hi>Gili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> was intreated to ſtand leſs on his Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity than on his Prudence, in this important conjuncture. <hi>Gilipus</hi> had no ſooner conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to depart, but <hi>Agis</hi> did conjure him to carry the Queen his daughter with him to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabeus. I ſhould never be at reſt,</hi> purſued he, <hi>if ſhe ſtaid in a Town where our Enemies have an abſolute Power. Ah, Sir, replied</hi> Agiatis,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:103174:100"/>in endeavouring to throw her ſelf at his Feet, <hi>for Heavens ſake do not oblige me to remove from you. Madam,</hi> replied <hi>Agis</hi> in taking her up, <hi>your Youth and Beauty may expoſe you to dangerous adventures, and the Obſervations</hi> Corymbus <hi>made before your journey to</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth <hi>ſhould make you ſtill ſomething cautious. Sir, replied</hi> Agiatis, <hi>ſince you have not yet forgotten what I am to fear from thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, remember I beſeech you, the misfortune with which they threaten you. Promiſe me that you will take warning your ſelf, and I will obey your Orders with leſs reluctancy. Depart without regret, Madam,</hi> replied <hi>Agis, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend nothing on my Scorè.</hi> Amphares, Democares, <hi>and</hi> Arcecilaus <hi>will not forſake me. That promiſe does not reaſſure me,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Queen, <hi>I perceive with the gratitude I ought, interrupted</hi> Agis, <hi>that nothing can appeaſe your diſquiets. Nevertheleſs, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, you ſhall ſee that my Misfortune is not ſo great as you imagine. I will go to take leave of you this Evening, and I pretend to have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my three Friends for my Guard.</hi> The Queens then ſeemed leſs afraid, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Gilipus.</hi> In a few hours after <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis</hi> went to viſit them, and ſaluted them with a more ſmiling Countenance than he was uſed to have. Far from talking with them about State Affairs, he rallied with
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:103174:100"/>them, and entertained them only with what he thought proper to divert them. He kept up the ſame humour in returning to his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, with <hi>Amphares, Democares,</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oecilaus,</hi> who bores him Company, and continued the Converſation, with greater jollity, than was uſual.</p>
            <p>But they were hardly ſeparated, when <hi>Democares</hi> grown outragious with Love and Jealouſie, believed himſelf the moſt unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Wretch in the World, in being obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to endure the Kings preſence, and the Queens abſence. He walked up and down in great agitation of Spirit, and as his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons reacht even Fury, he reſolved to proceed to all extremities, that he might ſatisfie him ſeif. The Confidence of <hi>Agis</hi> and the abſence of <hi>Gilipus</hi> encouraged him in his attempt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides he hoped <hi>Amphares</hi> would be very aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting to him. He knew that he was ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; that he loved independency; and that he would be glad that the Faction of the <hi>Agiades</hi> might no longer have a Prince for its Chief. He went to him, and after having attentively beheld him, he ſaid, <hi>Methinks that we might talk together with an entire ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, and that I need not fear to propoſe to you an undertaking worthy of us. If it be to free our Country, replied</hi> Amphares, <hi>I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to follow you. It is intolerable that all we
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:103174:101"/>do, ſhould be for</hi> Agis; <hi>and if we expoſe our lives, that he ſhould reap the advantage and glory of it. How glad am I, replied</hi> Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cares, <hi>to ſee you have ſuch generous ſentiments. I always believed that you were free from thoſe Scruples of which the People create Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to themſelves, and which ought never to trouble ſuch men as you are. Let us think of nothing elſe, but how to manage the favourable opportunity we now have. Let us ſhake off a Princes Yoak who will reduce us to a ſtrange ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, when he will have no longer need of us. I know that you have from</hi> Ageſiſtrate <hi>the magnificent Furniture with which you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed your Houſe, when you were created Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal</hi> Ephore, <hi>and perhaps you are not ignorant that</hi> Agis <hi>ſupplied me with means to undergo the Expence I have been at during our Civil Wars. You may be aſſured, we muſt reſtore all we have had from them, as ſoon as the Peace ſhall be concluded, if we have the baſeneſs not to put our ſelves in a condition of depending no longer on them while</hi> Agis<hi>'s deſtiny is in our hands. The Prince has at preſent no other ſupport than us and our Friends. Nothing is caſier than for us to rid our ſelves of him, nor is any thing more dangerous than to omit doing of it. You are</hi> Ephore; <hi>make uſe of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority your Office gives you. If our Civil Wars ſhould continue, and</hi> Leonidas, <hi>as it is
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:103174:101"/>moſt probable ſhould get the better, what ſhould we expect from a Conquerour, who will have ſeen us ſo affected to his Enemies? And would Fortune favour</hi> Agis, <hi>ſhould we be any gainers by it? Should we not ſee our ſelves deprived of all that is moſt precious in our Houſes. 'Tis enough,</hi> replied <hi>Amphares, let us talk no more, but go about the Execution of our deſign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then they contrived their execrable crime, and drew <hi>Arcecilaus</hi> into their Conſpiracy. They reſolved not to delay one moment. They went and found <hi>Agis:</hi> They rallied with him, as it had been for his diverſion; they went out with him, kept him Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to the Baths; and when he returned, they made him paſs through a by-Sreet, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which a door of the Priſon opened. As ſoon as they arrived over againſt that fatal place, <hi>Amphares</hi> in the Quality of <hi>Ephore,</hi> ſeized that Prince's Perſon, and <hi>Democares</hi> pulled him before, while <hi>Arcecilaus</hi> puſt him behind, being aſſiſted by other Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. As ſoon as they were within the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they ſent for ſome Magiſtrates of their own Faction, and <hi>Amphares</hi> having ſeated himſelf, commanded the King to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Government. <hi>Agis,</hi> inſtead of making any anſwer, began to ſmile; and <hi>Amphares</hi> growing red with anger, ſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolently to him, as all Hiſtorians report: <hi>Doſt
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:103174:102"/>thou laugh,</hi> Agis? <hi>But thou ſhalt ſoon ſee that it is rather time to weep.</hi> He ſaid no more, but Condemned his King to Death, and delivered him to thoſe People, who are accuſtomed to lead Criminals to their Puniſhment. Theſe Officers, leſs inhumane than their Superior, durſt not lay their Hands on <hi>Agis</hi>'s Perſon, until <hi>Democares,</hi> beholding them with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, accuſed them of Cowardiſe, and, to make them bold, was himſelf the firſt that ſeized <hi>Agis.</hi> The Prince ſtayed not to have greater violence offered him; he entred the place where they were uſed to put the Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Death, and there ended his Life, after the deplorable manner as is ſeen in Hiſtory. <hi>Amphares</hi> went to ſhew himſelf at the Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door, in order to prevent the People from riſing, and he ſingled out among the Crowd that ran together from all parts, <hi>Ageſiſtrate</hi> and <hi>Archidamia,</hi> who advanced crying, with their Faces all covered with Tears. Theſe two Princeſſes ſeemed leſs afraid, as ſoon as they perceived <hi>Amphares,</hi> and having acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted him with ſome Confidence, they ſaid, <hi>We know not what we have to hope or fear for a Perſon, who is infinitely dear unto us. How, Ladies,</hi> replied that Traytor, affecting moderation and reſpect, <hi>can you apprehend for the King, as long as I live, and am in Office? If you have forgot that I am of his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:103174:102"/>Party, and that I am very much obliged to your ſelves, I cannot forbear to remember it, as grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as I ought. You may, if you pleaſe, come in and be witneſſes of all that ſhall paſs.</hi> Theſe words gave ſame comfort to <hi>Agis</hi>'s <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother.</hi> The Princeſſes thanked <hi>Amphares:</hi> but were no ſooner within the Priſon, but that perfidious Wretch beheld them with Fury, and changed the tone of his Voice. <hi>Go and ſee,</hi> ſaid he to them, <hi>in what manner they have puniſht the Crimes of</hi> Agis, <hi>and ſince you have been Acceſſaries to them, prepare your ſelves for the ſame deſtiny. Archidamia</hi> and <hi>Ageſiſtrate,</hi> ſeeing the unfortunate <hi>Agis</hi> ſtill tied to the Fatal Cord, that ended his life, cried out, <hi>Poor Prince, was that the recompence due to thy Virtue?</hi> The Executioners interup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, and <hi>Ageſiſtrate</hi> lifting up her Eyes to Heaven, ſaid, <hi>The Gods grant that all this may turn to the advantages of</hi> Sparta. She being ſtill young, and beautiful enough, intreated that her body might be covered, when ſhe ſhould no longer be in a Condition to take that care of it her ſelf, and then both ſhe and <hi>Archidamia</hi> bravely underwent their Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonidas</hi> was no ſooner informed of ſo ſtrange an adventure, but he thought how to maintain himſelf King alone. In the mean time he feared leſt the Queen <hi>Agiatis,</hi> by marrying again, ſhould give him a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:103174:103"/>It was in her power to do it as <hi>Agis</hi>'s Widow, but indeed rather as the only Heireſs of the Family of the <hi>Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades.</hi> Therefore <hi>Leonidas</hi> deſired to have that Princeſs in his diſpoſal, and to forget nothing that might conduce to her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying with <hi>Cleomenes.</hi> He called <hi>Megaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> the Captain of his Guards. He gave him inſtructions, and ſent him to <hi>Erabeus</hi> with a Troop of choſen Souldiers.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide <hi>Democares</hi> aſſembled the Principal of his Party, and ſpoke to them with all the violence that Love and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition could give him. <hi>Friends,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>after this that we have dared, what may we not attempt? We are rid of</hi> Agis. <hi>One of us muſt ſupply his place, and make himſelf King. Otherwiſe we ſhall have acted only againſt our own intereſts, and put our ſelves under a greater Subjection, by rendring the Power of</hi> Leonidas <hi>more abſolute. Let us go and make our ſelves Maſters of Queen</hi> Agiatis: <hi>Let one of us eſpouſe her, and ſo become the ſupport of our Faction. Amphares,</hi> and the hotteſt of his Party, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded that propoſition: but <hi>Arcecilaus,</hi> and ſome others, demonſtrated that it was not yet a proper time to execute it. <hi>I would fain know,</hi> ſaid <hi>Arcecilaus</hi> to <hi>Democares, after what manner you intend to bring about
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:103174:103"/>your deſign? If you go out of</hi> Lacedemon <hi>with a ſmall number of Friends, you will be looked on as Criminals, who fly from the puniſhment of their Offences. If you lead all the Forces you have,</hi> Leonidas <hi>will ſee himſelf Maſter of</hi> Sparta, <hi>and will ſhut the Gates againſt you, when you think to return thither. Let us, I pray, defer that attempt for a while. Let us ſee what Face the Affairs of the Republick will take, and when they ſhall be in a ſetled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, we will then ſeek the means of making your Reſolution ſucceed. In the mean time I intreat you, moderate your ſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that your particular advantages depend upon the general Intereſts of our Party. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to you, that 'tis a Friend who ſpeaks unto you, I offer my ſelf to be the firſt to follow you, when a favourable Conjuncture will give us leave; and I give, even you, my Suffrage to marry</hi> Agiatis. The whole Aſſembly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of <hi>Arcecilaus</hi>'s Opinion; and <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cares</hi> replied to theſe laſt words, with marks of acknowledgment. Nevertheleſs, his Temper and his Love rendred him ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, that he went on the morrow to viſit <hi>Arcecilaus,</hi> and he told him, that they muſt no longer delay ſeizing the Queen. <hi>If we lee,</hi> purſued he, <hi>the firſt days of her ſorrow paſs, ſhe will open her Eyes, and think on her own Safety. She will be able to fly away into ſome
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:103174:104"/>State, who' will arm for her Intereſts. She will poſſibly give her ſelf away, together with the Rights of her Houſe to ſome Prince, who will find no great difficulty to make himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the</hi> Lacedemonians, <hi>while they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. It is ſufficient, that</hi> Amphares <hi>ſtays in</hi> Sparta. <hi>He will retain the People there in their Duty, and our Party in their Vigour. In the mean time, we both will quit the Town: We will take ſome Horſe from the Neighbouring places: We will go and ſurprize</hi> Agiatis, <hi>and then we ſhall eaſily ſeize her. Arcecilaus</hi> conſented to it. They departed, but they found an Obſtacle which oppoſed the Execution of their deſign.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Megabates</hi> was already arrived at <hi>Erabeus;</hi> but ſince no body ſaw <hi>Agiatis,</hi> by reaſon of her extream Affliction, he had deſired to ſpeak with <hi>Leriana. Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, Leonidas <hi>is ſo far from having been concerned in the Aſſaſſination which has been committed, that he is ready to revenge a death which all Kings have an Intereſt not to leave unpuniſht. This is not all, purſued</hi> Megabates, <hi>for ſince the Queen's Life is dear unto you, 'tis time that you think on the preſervation of it. You know that neither</hi> Ageſiſtrate <hi>nor</hi> Archidamia, <hi>have been ſpared,</hi> Agiatis <hi>may be threatned with the like deſtiny. The Murderers of</hi> Agis <hi>have reaſon to fear leſt ſhe ſhould make ſome Alliance to ruine them, and ſome Villains who make
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:103174:104"/>little Conſcience of a Crime will reſolve to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent her. The King my Maſter proffers her his Protection in</hi> Lacedemon, <hi>and ſends me to guard her. Conſider that it is high time you take your meaſures, and that the minutes are precious on this occaſion. Leriana</hi> beheld <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabates,</hi> and examined him, and then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing her Speech to him, ſhe anſwered, <hi>I queſtion not, but you are perſwaded of what you ſay. Your Countenance would deceive me, if you ſpeak againſt your own Sentiments. Nevertheleſs,</hi> Megabates, <hi>after the Treaehery of</hi> Amphares <hi>and</hi> Democares, <hi>what oſſurance can one have? Shall it be in the Promiſes of a Prince who has always been an Enemy to the</hi> Agiades? <hi>Ha! Madam,</hi> interrupted he, <hi>open your Eyes, I intreat you; conſider if</hi> Leonidas <hi>had any intereſt in diſpatching the Queen</hi> Agia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, <hi>he would never fail of means to bring it about, without being obliged to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Diſſimulation you imagine. 'Twould be an-Artifice that would draw upon him the indignation of all the Earth. Why then,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Leriana</hi> impationtly, <hi>would King</hi> Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidas <hi>take care of a Princeſs whoſe Family he has alwaies hated? How, replied</hi> Megabates, <hi>is it poſſible that you have not ſeen at the firſt what is</hi> Leonidas<hi>'s deſign? He pretends to leave the Prince</hi> Clomenes <hi>ſole King of</hi> Lacedemon, <hi>and he cannotdo it in a way, either more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:103174:105"/>to himſelf, or more agreeable to the People, than by matching his Son to the Heireſs of the</hi> Agiades. <hi>Leriana</hi> effectually ſaw that <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> would receive very great Advantages by this Alliance, as well as <hi>Agiatis</hi> would a re-eſtabliſhment. She could not ſuſpect <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidas</hi> of any Treachery; and after having expreſſed her Acknowledgment to <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,</hi> ſhe promiſed him to mediate for the ſucceſs of the Negotiation, with which he was charged. She took her time to ſpeak to the Queen, and forgot none of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Reaſons <hi>Megabates</hi> had given, to make her depart immediately. <hi>Agiatis</hi> anſwers not in a long time, but with her ſighs, and at length turning towards <hi>Leriana</hi> her fair Eye, all moiſt with Tears, ſhe ſaid, <hi>Had I not better let my Sorrow kill me, than ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> Leonidas <hi>Moſter of my Deſtiny? What! would</hi> Leriana <hi>truſt my Life with my Enemies? If I had any care remaining for my Safety, it would be far from</hi> Leonidas <hi>that I would ſeek Protection. However, Madam,</hi> replied <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana I am perſwaded that</hi> Leonidas <hi>has no other than good Intentions for you. Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would not doubt it any more than I, if the Condition wherein I ſee you, did give me leave to explain my ſelf a little more preciſely.</hi> She durſt ſay nothing of <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. The death of <hi>Agis</hi> was too freſh; and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:103174:105"/>a ſtrong teaderneſs, which <hi>Agiatis</hi> had not been able to baniſh out of her Heart, ſince the Journey of <hi>Corinth,</hi> had given the Princeſs an Averſion for all kind of Engagements. So that <hi>Letiana</hi> was unwilling to enter, ſo ſoon, into that particular, and contented her ſelf with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trearing the Queen to take a ſpeedy Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>In the name of Heaven, Madam,</hi> added ſhe with Tears in her Eyes, <hi>abandon your ſelf once more to my Conduct. Agiatis</hi> perceiving how much <hi>Leriana</hi> was prepoſſeſt in favour of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onidas,</hi> felt a double deſpite againſt a Prince, who conſtrained her, either to owe him her Life, or to deny what <hi>Leriana</hi> demanded of her. As ſhe endeavoured to reſolve on one of theſe vexatious Extremities, <hi>Cyleſira</hi> entred with terror in her Face, and gave them notice, that <hi>Democares</hi> and <hi>Aroecilaus</hi> advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Erabeus,</hi> at the head of a great Body of Horſe. <hi>O Heaven,</hi> cried out <hi>Leriana, will you again permit theſe perſidious Traytors to execute a new Attempt? Fear nothing on my ſcore,</hi> Leri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana, replied <hi>Agiatis</hi> with a firm Voice. <hi>Thoſe who deſpiſe Life, can, when they pleaſe, ſecure themſelves from all ſorts of Evils. You ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee me in</hi> Democares<hi>'s Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While ſhe endeavoured to re-aſſure <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and,</hi> and <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> gave Orders for the defence of the Houſe, <hi>Arcecilans</hi> arrived at the Gate, and ſaid, with an imperious tone, that the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:103174:106"/>Queen ſhould come down. He added, that there was not one minute to be loſt, if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſave her. That the Great Men of the Common-wealth, who had lately freed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from a Prince that deſired their ruine, might carry, even to another extremity, their revenge, or rather their precaution. <hi>Megabates</hi> informed of all that paſſed, ran thither, knew <hi>Arcecilaus,</hi> and having fiercely beheld him, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him. <hi>Get you back, and tell your Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, that they themſelves provide for their own Securities, by a ſpeedy flight. Well then,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Arcecilaus, I go back, but it is to return again to thy ſorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Megabates</hi>'s Troop aſſembled, and ranged themſelves, while <hi>Democares</hi>'s and <hi>Arceci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>'s advanced on a full Trot. They were hardly in ſight, when <hi>Democares</hi> divided his into two Bodies. He kept one to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which he cauſed to alight, and did lead it directly up to the Gate of <hi>Erabeus,</hi> with battering Rams and Mantelets. <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi> received him with flights of Arrows, and commanded that all the Javelines and Partizans they had, ſhould be made ready, in order to defend the Breach, in caſe they could not hinder the Enemies from making one. <hi>Democares,</hi> whoſe Love and Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on increaſed his Natural Audacity, exhorted his Men, expoſed himſelf the firſt, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:103174:106"/>threatned <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> with a terrible Death, if he continued obſtinate in his reſiſtance. <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> darted a Javeline for Anſwer. The Zeal he had for the Queen, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment againſt <hi>Democares,</hi> ſo encouraged him, that he reſolved to dye with his Sword in his Hand, rather than ſee <hi>Agiatis</hi> fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power of ſuch a Villain.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide; <hi>Arcecilaus</hi> and <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates</hi> charged impetuouſly on one another. They were wounded with the firſt blows they ſtruck; but if their Combate began with equality enough, in a few moments after it took a different Face. <hi>Leonidas</hi>'s Guards being better diſciplined than Men newly raiſed, broke in upon their Enemies, cut ſome part of them in pieces, and put to flight the reſt. <hi>Arcecilaus</hi> ran before the Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, to bring them back to their Charge. He got ſome of them together again, and while he called out to others to rally; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a blow from a Javeline, which hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a faulty place in his Cuiraſs, entred into his Body, and ſtruck him dead. <hi>Democares</hi> had no ſooner notice of it, but he remoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Horſes, threatned <hi>Leoſthenes,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, facing often upon the Enemy, and diſcharging ſeveral flights of Arrows.</p>
            <pb n="214" facs="tcp:103174:107"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Leriana,</hi> who could not forbear looking on this action every moment, through a little Window, ſaw the ſucceſs of it with an extraordinary Joy. She ran to tell the Queen the News. <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid ſhe to her, <hi>the Gods have not ſuffered you to fall into the hands of the Traiterous</hi> Democares; <hi>and what</hi> Megabates <hi>has done for your Defence, ought to perſwade you more than all my reaſons to truſt your ſelf to his Conduct.</hi> Leonidas <hi>is of too Illuſtrious a Blood, to be capable of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a baſe Treaſon, under the generous proffers that are made you in his behalf. I know well enough, replied</hi> Agiatis, <hi>what are his and your intentions,</hi> Leonidas <hi>will not be ſo couti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to tell them me; but</hi> Leriana, <hi>I will not accept his proffers, how advantageous ſoever they may ſeem to you. After this conſider whether we ought to go to</hi> Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; <hi>whether I ought to expoſe my ſelf to receive good Offices from a Prince, to whom I am reſolved to deny the return which he will have reaſon to pretend to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She ended theſe words, juſt as <hi>Megabates</hi> entred, and told her it was no longer time to conſider. <hi>You muſt, Madam, abſolutely ſave your ſelf while the wayes are yet open. I have juſt now notice brought me, that a body of Horſe
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:103174:107"/>begins to appear, and that</hi> Democares <hi>goes to joyn it. He may poſſibly return with that reinforcement. Yet if you do not delay your departure, I will carry you to</hi> Lacedemon, <hi>through a by-Road which will make you avoid meeting with your Enemies. Leriand</hi> added her intreaties, and accompanied them with ſome Tears, ſo that at length <hi>Agiatis</hi> yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and told <hi>Megabates</hi> that ſhe would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Counſel. Afterwards add reſſing her ſelf to <hi>Leriana,</hi> ſhe continued with a lower Voice; <hi>I perceive well enough, that I muſt give way to my deſtiny. Nothing can prevent the accompliſhment of</hi> Corymbas<hi>'s Prediction; ſince</hi> Leriana <hi>her ſelf aſſiſts to bring it to paſs.</hi> They immediately prepare every thing for their departure, <hi>Megabates</hi> and <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> cauſed their Wounds, which were but ſlight, to be dreſt, and then took the way towards <hi>Sparta,</hi> at the head of the Squadron.</p>
            <p>That was no falſe advice which was given <hi>Megabates. Democares</hi> had indeed diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Body of Horſe which marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the River <hi>Eurotas,</hi> and taking it for ſome aſſiſtance, which Fortune offered him, he had advanced and demanded to ſpeak with the Commander in Chief. He had an intention to gain him by Promiſes and Preſents, when he ſaw coming up to him a young Man of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:103174:108"/>Meen, and covered with magnificent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. He was <hi>Cleomenes</hi> who was returning to <hi>Sparta,</hi> followed by the five hundred Horſe of whom <hi>Aratus</hi> had given him the Command. <hi>Democares</hi> had no ſooner underſtood he was that Prince, but ſaluting him with ſeveral ſigns of joy in his face, ſaid to him, <hi>Ah! Sir, Heaven without doubt has made us meet for your good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</hi> After theſe words he intreated <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to walk a little aſide, and having carried him into a little Wood <hi>I know,</hi> purſued he, <hi>that you have never cared for</hi> Agiatis; <hi>however they are going to carry her away by</hi> Leonidas<hi>'s Command, in order to force you to marry her. Prevent that deſign;</hi> Agiatis <hi>is ſtill at</hi> Erabeus, <hi>and if you will reinforce my Troop with a Party of yours, I will ſoon carry that Princeſs far enough from</hi> Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. When the Prince had heard him out, in ſpite of his impatience, he fiercely anſwered; <hi>I ſee by the propoſition which you preſume to make me, that you know me not very well. Far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting that the Queen</hi> Agiatis <hi>ſhould be treated in ſuch a manner, I will take her part againſt all thoſe who ſhall have the inſolence to fail in their duty towards her. The declaration thou makeſt,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Democares,</hi> bluſhing with anger, <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not terrifie ſuch men as I am; and I would let thee ſee, that it ſhould not hinder me from attempting—Let us ſee,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> laying his had to his Sword,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:103174:108"/>
               <hi>whether it would be eaſie for thee to perform it.</hi> They were both exaſperated, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſtruck at each other, and ſince they never thought of parrying, they were both wounded, but in a different manner. <hi>Democares</hi> had diſcharged a back blow at <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s head, and the Prince having ſtoopt to reach home into the Enemies body, was but ſlightly wounded in the left ſhoulder, and he thruſt his Sword into <hi>Democares</hi>'s right ſide. That <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian</hi> became more enraged, takes leſs heed, and flying furiouſly on <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> lays himſelf ſo open, that the Prince fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not to run his Sword through his Body. <hi>Democares</hi> fell down, and having caſt his Eyes upon his Conquerour, which dying as they were, did not however ceaſe to be full of fierceneſs, he ſaid to him,
<q>Thou gaineſt a victory more important than thou doſt believe. Thou reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt <hi>Agis.</hi> Thou delivereſt Perſons of thine own Rank from a profeſſed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who made no greater eſtimation of Kings than of ordinary men. In a word, 'tis <hi>Democares</hi> whom thou haſt overcome. The Prince was ſeized with horrour at that Name, but when he beheld that Monſter of Perfidiouſneſs; and ſince he could not inſult over him in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:103174:109"/>wherein he ſaw him,</q> he anſwered him only in theſe few words.:
<q>Dye at leaſt with ſome Repentance for thy Crimes. Men of my humour never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, replied <hi>Democares,</hi> and if I feel any regret in loſing my life, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a certain fear I have, leſt thou ſhould'ſt be the poſſeſſor of the moſt beautiful Princeſs that ever was.</q> After theſe words he looked angrily on <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> then his Eyes grew troubled, and he dyed. The Prince rejoined his Troop, cauſed notice to be given to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocares</hi>'s, that it had no longer any Chief, and if it would come over to him, he would give them very good Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thoſe Cavaliers were no ſooner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that it was Prince <hi>Cleomenes</hi> who made them theſe proffers, but they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Orders, and marcht with him towards <hi>Lacedemon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> was no ſooner arrived there, but after having ſeen the King and Queen, he was conſtrained at their intreaty to put himſelf in bed. He remained there with impatience. He enquired every moment after News from <hi>Agiatis,</hi> and at length he was informed that ſhe had juſt entred the City. <hi>Leonidas</hi> cauſed the fineſt
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:103174:109"/>Apartment of his Palace to be given that Princeſs. He ordered her to be ſerved with a great deal of diligence; but ſince he had commanded alſo that they ſhould moſt ſtrictly guard her, <hi>Agiatis</hi> complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of that proceeding, and declared that it was not by ſuch Treatment they would be able to gain upon her Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> no ſooner underſtood what were <hi>Agiatis</hi>'s Sentiments, but he loſt all his joy. He feared leſt the Princeſs might hate him, as ſoon as ſhe ſhould know that he was <hi>Leonidas</hi>'s Son, ſo that he took a ſtrong reſolution not to appear before her, but as <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> until ſhe ſhould be more favourable to <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He aroſe in the Evening, he went ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to <hi>Agiatis</hi>'s Lodgings, and took ſome meaſures not to be known there. He had hardly deſired leave to enter, but that at the name of <hi>Themiſtides, Agiatis</hi> appeared moved, and the Prince could not ſee her without tranſports of joy, which he endeavoured to moderate. Inſtead of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting appear any marks of his Love and Joy, he endeavoured to accommodate himſelf
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:103174:110"/>to the Queens humour, and not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach her without ſadneſs in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. In order to produce ſpeedily ſuch an Effect, he thought on the averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which <hi>Agiatis</hi> might have for <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> and he received on that Score ſo real a ſorrow, that his Air became as melancholy as decency could require. He advanced towards her with fear, and the Queen beginning to ſpeak after as obliging a manner, as that conjuncture could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her, ſhe ſaid to him with a ſigh, <hi>Ah!</hi> Themiſtides, <hi>you ſee</hi> Agiatis <hi>a Priſoner, and much more unfortunate than</hi> Cyleſira. <hi>I would to the Gods, Madam, replied</hi> Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omenes, <hi>that you your ſelf could ſee how far I am ſenſible of what concerns you. I am ſo perſwaded that you take a great ſhare therein,</hi> replied the Queen, <hi>that I am very willing to tell you, that you have always been the perſon on whom I firſt thought, whenever any ill accident happened to me, as if it was from you I was to expect ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the greateſt aſſiſtance, or the greateſt conſolation in my Misfortunes. Cleomenes</hi> bowed moſt reſpectfully in witneſs of his acknowledgment, and renewing the diſcourſe ſaid; <hi>I ſtill dare flatter my ſelf, Madam, that I ſhall not be altogether unprofitable to you on this Occaſion. I have ſome Credit in</hi>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:103174:110"/>Leonidas<hi>'s Court, and if you will be pleaſed to inform me, after what manner you were brought hither—You may ſay,</hi> interrupted ſhe, <hi>after what manner I was forced hither, and do not palliate this ſecond Affront, which the Prince you mention has given me. But I am very much miſtaken, if his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt will have the ſucceſs he expects. You ſhall ſee that I am no leſs ſenſible of Injuries, than of good Offices. Themiſtides</hi> heard not theſe laſt words without Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, by reaſon of the Intereſt that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> ought to have in them; and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Queen with an Air more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy than before, ſaid to her, <hi>Give me leave, if you pleaſe, Madam, to aſſure you, that</hi> Cleomenes <hi>is not at all guilty, and that he never had for the admirable Queen of</hi> Lacedemon <hi>any Sentiments, of which ſhe would have reaſon to complain, if ſhe knew them perfectly. Agiatis</hi> was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at that anſwer, and hiding the vexation which ſhe had in her ſoul, ſhe replied coldly; <hi>I find you more generous yet, than I imagined; and ſince you are a Friend to Prince</hi> Cleomenes, <hi>if you think be will come to ſee me, you will do me a favour to prevent him. For your part, I have been willing to grant you a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which I never give any: but I pray
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:103174:111"/>make no uſe of it for a ſecond Viſit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Themiſtides</hi> did withdraw in a mortal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and did not queſtion but that <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> was really hated. He complained of it to <hi>Philiſtion; Have you ever ſeen,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>a Man more unfortunate than I? I am deſperately in love, and cannot ſee that I have any manner of hopes. You may well judge that the unknown</hi> Themiſtides <hi>can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pretend to the Queen of</hi> Lacedemon; <hi>and I can aſſure you, that the Son of</hi> Leonidas <hi>ſhall be yet worſe entertained than</hi> Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides. <hi>But, Sir,</hi> replied <hi>Philiſtion, if in making your ſelf known to be</hi> Cleomenes, <hi>you repair in</hi> Themiſlides <hi>the inequality of your Conditions, can you not then hope to be happy? Ah, Philiſtion,</hi> replied <hi>Cleomenes, Can you counſel me to declare my ſelf, while</hi> Agiatis <hi>ſhall have an ill Opinion of</hi> Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? <hi>Shall I run the hazard of drawing on my ſelf, during my whole life, that Perſon's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, wham I adore? No,</hi> Philiſtion, <hi>I will never do it; I had rather renounce entirely all the advantages which my Birth can give me, than the Friendſhip, which</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſira <hi>has already expreſt for</hi> Themiſtides. That was the Reſolution which the Prince took. <hi>Philiſtion</hi> ſtill adviſed againſt it, but he ſoon ſaw that all his Reaſons were to no purpoſe.</p>
            <pb n="223" facs="tcp:103174:111"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Agiatis,</hi> for her part, was not diſpoſed to paſs the Night with more Tranquillity. She cauſed <hi>Cyleſira</hi> to be called to her, that ſhe might eaſe her Heart, by diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering her new vexation. <hi>Leriana</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſurprized to ſee ſome trouble in her Countenance, and as ſhe was juſt a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enquire the cauſe of it, the Queen with a ſigh ſaid, <hi>Would you have believed that</hi> Themiſtides <hi>would ſpeak to me in the behalf of</hi> Cleomenes? <hi>Perhaps,</hi> replied <hi>Cyleſira, he would have endeavoured ſome accomme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. How little do you underſtand me,</hi> interrupted the Queen impatiently, <hi>if</hi> Themiſtides <hi>endeavoured to reconcile us, would he not rather endeavour to juſtifie</hi> Leonidas, <hi>than engage in</hi> Cleomenes<hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, after a manner, that could not be otherwiſe than diſagreeable to me? Have you ever heard me complain of the Prince of</hi> Lacedemon? <hi>On the contrary, I praiſed his Generoſity, when he oppoſed the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the King his Father, and when he drew me out of the hands of my Raviſhers: I was pleaſed that he bad delivered us from</hi> Democares, <hi>that Monſter of perfide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and I have been informed, not without pleaſure, that he was mounded in the Shoulder in that Combate. But I find</hi>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:103174:112"/>Themiſtides <hi>more officious than I could wiſh, when he would make me comprehend, that I am not indifferent to</hi> Cleomenes. <hi>If that Prince had thoſe Sentiments for me, which</hi> Themiſtides <hi>would perſwade me he hath, would he not have followed</hi> Leonidas<hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, rather than have croſſed them, and thereby have angered a Father, whom I know he had always obeyed? Let us rather ſay,</hi> Cyleſira, <hi>let us ſay, that I have not known</hi> Themiſtides <hi>throughly to this hour, that he is leſs capable of Tenderneſs than Ambition, and that ſacrificing every thing to his Fortune, he wiſhes to unite</hi> Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes <hi>and</hi> Agiatis, <hi>the better to make his Court to</hi> Leonidas. <hi>But ſince he is ſo gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a Reward, I will that he be paid to morrow what I owe him, and then that he leave me in repoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While ſhe takes that Reſolution, <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phares,</hi> who foreſaw the ruine of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, lays aſide all other thoughts, than thoſe of ſaving himſelf. Nevertheleſs he does not depart without ſome hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning with a re-inforcement. He goes to <hi>Megabates,</hi> where he underſtands that <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipus</hi> is gone back to <hi>Erabeus,</hi> and he promiſes <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> to ſet him up in the room of <hi>Agis. Cleombrotus,</hi> with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:103174:112"/>hears a Man who flatters his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and takes ſome meaſures with <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phares,</hi> to make their Enterprize ſucceed. They ſecretly levy Troops, and <hi>Cheloniſa</hi> is no ſooner advertiſed of it, but ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> to have no confidence in a Traytor, whom he ought to avoid with Horror. <hi>I pray,</hi> anſwered <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently, <hi>do not oppoſe my Deſigns, I will not loſe this opportunity of re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf; and I am aſſured, that</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phares<hi>'s Party is not ſo low, as that I ought, through vain ſcruples, renounce the aſſiſtance I may receive from it. Cheloniſa</hi> would have replied again, but <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> intreated her to hold her peace, and to withdraw. The Inhabitants of <hi>Megalopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> no ſooner knew that <hi>Amphares</hi> was in their City, and that he gathered Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers together, but they reſolved to chaſe him out of it, and came in Crowds to his Houſe. <hi>Amphares,</hi> who had already armed Men about him, failed not to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a poſture of Defence, believing that they had a deſign on his Life. But the Gates of his Houſe were broke open, and he was cut in pieces; alſo <hi>Cleombro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> who ran to his aſſiſtance, found no better Deſſiny. The Magiſtrates went to find <hi>Cheloniſa</hi> in a Temple, informed her
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:103174:113"/>of the Death of the Prince her Husband, and expreſt to her their ſorrow for it. <hi>Cheloniſa,</hi> after having given ſome Tears, which Generoſity made her ſhed for a Man who deſerved them not, thought of returning to <hi>Lacedemon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas about that time that <hi>Agiatis</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Reſolution ſhe had taken, of breaking with <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> after having made him ſome conſiderable Preſent. She called <hi>Leriana,</hi> and ſaid to her, <hi>I pray give</hi> Themiſtides <hi>what Jewels I have left. You ſhall tell him, that I ſee none; let him call to mind that I have already advertiſed him of it, and that he will oblige me to come no more to my Appartment. Leriana,</hi> who ardently deſired that <hi>Agiatis</hi> ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to <hi>Leonidas</hi>'s Deſign, was very glad that <hi>Themiſtides</hi> ſhould ſee the Queen no more, and laid aſide all thoughts, but thoſe of obeying the Order ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. But ſhe was very much ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, when the Kings Officers, of whom ſhe enquired after <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> anſwered her, that they knew him not, and that they had never heard mention of any ſuch Man. She gave an account of it to the Queen, who was likewiſe amazed at it. 'Tis true, they did not remain long
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:103174:113"/>in that uncertainty. <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> who could not live without ſeeing <hi>Agiatis,</hi> reſolved to diſcourſe with <hi>Leriana,</hi> to juſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before her; and to intreat her to make his Peace. He went to her Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and was received with an Air, that ſeemed to promiſe an happy ſucceſs to his viſit. <hi>What Joy do you give me,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>to come ſo opportunely. The Queen has cauſed ſearch to be made for you, and has given me a Commiſſion, which ought not to be diſpleaſing to you. Cleomenes,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the hope he had conceived, waits impatiently for <hi>Leriana</hi> to explain her ſelf, when ſhe takes the Jewels, and makes a proffer of them, in the behalf of <hi>Agiatis,</hi> as a mark of her acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Prince looks ſadly on <hi>Leria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> without caſting his Eyes on the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. <hi>Madam,</hi> ſays he to her, <hi>by what Crime, do you believe I have drawn upon my ſelf this kind of recompence. If you have forgotten,</hi> replied <hi>Leriana, that it is for the great ſervice you have done, 'tis juſt that the Queen remember it. Suffer me, I intreat you,</hi> replied <hi>Themiſtides, that I complain to the Queen of an uſage, which ſhe did not, perhaps, intend as an Affront to me. If it be to puniſh me for having ſaid well of</hi> Cleomenes, <hi>ſhe may pardon me
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:103174:114"/>a Fault which I will never commit again. Neither ſhall there be any more mention made of</hi> Themiſtides, <hi>when once</hi> Cleomenes <hi>ſhall be ſeen to appear. How!</hi> interrupted <hi>Leriana</hi> with ſurprize, <hi>is</hi> Agiatis <hi>angry with you, and forbids you to ſee her, for no other reaſon, but becauſe you are inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Intereſts of the Prince of</hi> Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. <hi>That is the ſubject of my Diſgrace,</hi> replied <hi>Themiſtides. Ah! ſince 'tis that</hi> replied <hi>Leriana, I declare my ſelf for you, and I will loſe my Credit, or I will make your Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leriana</hi> found nevertheleſs a great deal of difficulty, to obtain leave for <hi>Themiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> to ſee again <hi>Agiatis,</hi> and if that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs did, at laſt, conſent to it, it was for once only, and to force him to accept thoſe Jewels he had refuſed. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> did advance towards her with no very good aſſurance; and obſerving that there ſtill remained ſome ſeverity in her Eyes, he conceived ſo great Grief at it, that <hi>Agiatis,</hi> who took notice of it, felt her Heart growing tender. Nevertheleſs ſhe did not ſuffer any ſign of that change to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in her Face; and ſhe even reſolved to renounce, for ever, the ſight of <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides.</hi> In the mean time that Lover
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:103174:114"/>throws himſelf at her Feet; and <hi>Agiatis</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to raiſe him up, hurts his Wound. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> grows pale, and the Queen having obſerved it, asked him the cauſe of it, with greater earneſtneſs than ſhe would willingly have ſhewn. The Prince had no ſooner ſaid, that a pain proceeded from a Wound he had in his left Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but the Princeſs beheld him with greater application than before. After having recalled into her memory, all things that could confirm her Conjecture,
<q>O ye Gods! <hi>cried ſhe out,</hi> what is it I ſee? What! is <hi>Themiſtides</hi> intereſſed for the Prince of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and is he wounded in the left Shoulder? It is no longer to be doubted, <hi>Themiſtides</hi> is <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> as <hi>Cyleſira</hi> was <hi>Agiatis.</hi> Confeſs, <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> confeſs, I conjure you, and leave me not in the uncertainty wherein you ſee me. Since you command me, Madam, <hi>replied the Prince,</hi> I confeſs, I am <hi>Cleomenes.</hi> O Heaven, <hi>cried out</hi> Leriana <hi>in her turn,</hi> what a happineſs is this, after ſo many mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes! Ah, <hi>Leriana,</hi> replied <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> do not flatter me with any hope, unleſs you would diſpleaſe the Queen. I perceive plainly, that I ſhall never be but unfortunate, either as I am <hi>Themiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> or <hi>Cleomenes.</hi> You know that at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:103174:115"/>and in the Iſle of <hi>Egina, Cyleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> took away from me all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſeeing her. I did my duty, <hi>repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Queen,</hi> I defended a Heart, which, I might well imagine, Prince <hi>Gilipus</hi> would never have diſpoſed of, in favour of <hi>Themiſtides.</hi> I know not, <hi>replied the Prince of</hi> Lacedemon, whether <hi>Cleomenes</hi> ſhall have any better Deſtiny; but I have obſerved certain croſs accidents that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage no great good. In effect, Madam, when <hi>Leonidas</hi> takes his meaſures, to carry you away, and make me happy, I oppoſe his Attempts and my own good Fortune. But I do not repent of what I have done. Neither would I have had my own Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city have coſt you one moments vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen hearkned to him with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; ſhe beheld <hi>Cleomenes</hi> with Eyes, that ſeemed no longer enraged; but as ſhe kept ſilence;
<q>How, Madam, <hi>ſaid</hi> Leria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, you give the Prince no anſwer, after ſo obliging a Proteſtation. I am very glad, <hi>replied the Queen,</hi> that he has been ſo generous, in reſpect of <hi>Agiatis,</hi> and ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to <hi>Cyleſira.</hi> Both the one and the other deſerve to be remembred with acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But, Sir, <hi>added ſhe with ſome diſquiet,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:103174:115"/>addreſſing her ſelf to</hi> Cleomenes, leave me I intreat you alone, and do not oblige me to talk any more of you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> was tranſported with joy, that he put one knee to the Earth to thank the Queen, and went to relate to the King all that had paſſed. <hi>Leonidas</hi> and <hi>Creteſilea</hi> are no leſs ſatisfied with it than the Prince, and went immediately to <hi>Agitatis</hi>'s Apartment. Though their viſit had nothing in it but what was very agreeable, yet it did not laſt long; for beſides that it was late, notice was brought to <hi>Leonidas,</hi> that <hi>Cheloniſa</hi> was juſt arrived.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> on the morrow fail'd not to viſit <hi>Agiatis,</hi> as ſoon as Decency permitted him to enter her Chamber; he told her immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately that nothing retained her in the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which had been given her. <q>You may go out of it when you pleaſe, <hi>continued he,</hi> the King has been graciouſly pleaſed, that I ſhould have the pleaſure of declaring it to you. If it be my Liberty you give me,</q> 
               <hi>replied the Queen,</hi> 
               <q>you will be pleaſed that I make uſe of it, to return to <hi>Erabeus.</hi> Is it poſſible, Madam, <hi>anſwered he with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,</hi> that you would leave us ſo ſpeedily, and that you will not deſign to make ſome ſtay at <hi>Sparta?</hi> I confeſs, <hi>replied ſhe,</hi> here is ſomething I ſain would ſee. 'Tis <hi>Queen Chelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſa,</hi>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:103174:116"/>whoſe Merit and Beauty attracts the admiration of all <hi>Greece.</hi> The Princeſs, to whom you give the praiſes that are due to your ſelf, <hi>replied</hi> Cleomenes, would have been already with you, if ſhe had not gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me theſe moments which I did demand of her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He had hardly ended theſe words, when he ſaw <hi>Cheloniſa</hi> enter and he went out to give that Princeſs a greater liberty of ſpeaking, being well aſſured that ſhe would not forget his intereſts.</p>
            <p>The two Queens beheld each other with amazement, and having advanced the one towards the other, they embraced with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny marks of Eſteem and Tenderneſs, as if they had been long ſince acquainted. I <hi>aſſure you, Madam, ſaid</hi> Agiatis <hi>to</hi> Cheloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, <hi>that you ſhould not have prevented me, if Priſoners were the diſpoſers of their own Wills. You know, Madam,</hi> anſwered the Daughter of <hi>Leonidas, that if you were brought into this Palace, it was rather to proffer you a Crown, than to give you Chains. Be the intention what it will, replied</hi> Agiatis, <hi>I cannot complain of a force that brings me to ſee Queen</hi> Cheloniſa <hi>I would have ſeen you at Prince</hi> Gilipus's, replied ſhe, <hi>if the difference between our Families had allowed me to give my ſelf that ſatisfaction. Beſides,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:103174:116"/>Madam, you made a Journey to</hi> Corinth, <hi>and I for my part have always been out of</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon, <hi>either with a fugitive Father, or a baniſhed Husband. But, Madam, 'tis in your power now to unite our Houſes, more than the Civil Wars have divided them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agiatis</hi> bluſht, inſtead of making any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. 'Twas not, becauſe ſhe ſaw that <hi>Gili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> would joyfully make that Alliance, or becauſe ſhe perceived even her ſelf inclined to it, out of tenderneſs. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that it was not long ſince ſhe had loſt <hi>Agis,</hi> a ſentiment of baſhfulneſs hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred her to declare her ſelf in this firſt Converſation. She even creates to her ſelf a Scruple, which permits her not to ſhew at the firſt for the Prince of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> an inclination which ſhe had taken care to conceal from <hi>Themiſtides,</hi> and when ſhe found her ſelf diſpoſed to make a favourable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, her heart reproached her, that <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi>'s rank might have too great a ſhare in that ſecret motion.</p>
            <p>When ſhe ſpoke, it was after a manner, that without diſcovering too much of the inclination ſhe deſired to conceal, failed not to give <hi>Cheloniſa</hi> ſatisfaction. <hi>You know, Madam,</hi> ſaid ſhe to her, <hi>that there is no longer any diviſion in</hi> Lacedemon; <hi>that the King</hi> Leonidas <hi>is ſole Maſter there, and that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:103174:117"/>we have nothing elſe to do but to ſubmit to the Will of the Conquerour. Your will ſhall be obeyed, replied</hi> Cheloniſa, <hi>and we have nothing more to do, but to wiſh that it may not prove rigorous to a Prince who adores you.</hi> In ending theſe words, ſhe obſerved that there was no ſign of Averſion in <hi>Agiatis</hi>'s Eyes, and ſhe withdrew, to give <hi>Cleomenes</hi> an account of it.</p>
            <p>In a few moments after, <hi>Leonidas</hi> was advertiſed that ſome Horſe came from the parts towards <hi>Erabeus.</hi>
               <q>Sir, continued the Officer who gave him the notice, Prince <hi>Gilipus</hi> is at the head of that body, with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man whom I do not know. That Troop marches with a Confidence which ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly witneſſes it fears nothing, and is ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by others.</q> This Report gave <hi>Leonidas</hi> ſome diſquiet. <hi>Agiatis</hi> appeared moved, and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> received a mortal vexation at it. They were going to ſend once more to view it, when a certain <hi>Corinthian,</hi> who was a Kinſman of <hi>Philiſtion</hi>'s, arrived. That Stranger told <hi>Cleomenes</hi> that it was the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> who was coming to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and who brought <hi>Gilipus</hi> along with him, whom he had fetcht from <hi>Erabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
               <q>But this is not all Sir, <hi>purſued he,</hi> for as <hi>Aratus</hi> is at preſent a friend to the two Royal Families of <hi>Sparta,</hi> his coming is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:103174:117"/>to endeavour their Union, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to appeaſe the Troubles of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> ran to meet <hi>Aratus</hi> and <hi>Gilipus.</hi> He ſaid to <hi>Agiatis</hi>'s Father, the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful things that love could inſpire him with; and after having expreſſed his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment to the General of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaians,</hi> he ſhew'd them the way to the King his Father's Palace. <hi>Leonidas</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them at the Gate with more than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Joy. <hi>Agiatis</hi> was no leſs glad at the ſight of <hi>Gilipus,</hi> and after the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Compliments that are practiſed on ſuch occaſions, <hi>Aratus</hi> ſpoke of what he moſt paſſionately deſired to theſe Illuſtrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. He afterwards repreſented to them, that to confirm the Peace more ſolidly, <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> muſt be comprehended therein. He knew what were the ſentiments of his Son <hi>Hypomedon,</hi> and having brought that young Prince along with <hi>Gilipus,</hi> he preſented him to the King of <hi>Lacedemon. Hypomedon</hi> threw himſelf at <hi>Leonidas</hi>'s Feet, and that Prince who had always eſteemed him, had no ſooner taken him up, but he tenderly embraced him, and forgot the injuries he had received from his Father. Then <hi>Aratus</hi> ſaid to the King of <hi>Sparta,</hi>
               <q>Sir, I am ſo well pleaſed that I have married <hi>Teleander</hi> and <hi>Ariamite</hi> in
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:103174:118"/>one day, that I am come with a deſign of propoſing to you two Marriages. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ought to wiſh for that double Alliance in reſpect of their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and I queſtion not, but that you will conſent to the happineſs of four Perſons who were born only to be united. They ſhall be when you pleaſe, <hi>replied the King of</hi> Sparta, provided Prince <hi>Gilipus</hi> be not unwilling. I might poſſibly be, <hi>replied</hi> Agiatis<hi>'s Father with a ſmile,</hi> if I would oppoſe my Daughters Advantage, but ſince I am far enough from having any ſuch intentions, I ſhall only intreat you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute ſpeedily your deſign.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The four Lovers paſſed the reſt of the day in delights they had never before taſted. <hi>Clomenes</hi> and <hi>Agiatis</hi> did not forget the Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Philiſtion</hi> and <hi>Cyleſira,</hi> and on the morrow the two Marriages were ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated with a Joy that made the Miſeries of <hi>Sparta</hi> be forgotten.</p>
